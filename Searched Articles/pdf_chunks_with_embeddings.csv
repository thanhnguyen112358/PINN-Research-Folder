1|INTRODUCTION
Biomass energy is a low-carbon energy source, which is
abundant reserves, environmentally friendly, and renew-able.
1-4Biomass pyrolysis gasification technology converts
biomass energy into high-quality fuel gas. At present, the
traditional gasification methods have the disadvantages oflow energy efficiency, high gas production cost, and com-plex systems.
5,6In order to improve gas quality and reduce
production costs, biomass chemical looping gasification
technology is proposed.7Biomass chemical looping is an
emerging gasification technology.8Lattice oxygen in an
oxygen carrier is used to provide oxygen for the gasificationof biomass.9By controlling the",211,"[ 0.0253974   0.01395772  0.01713782 ...  0.00465348  0.01288321

mass fuel, after biomass gasification to obtain H 2, synthesis
gas is produced, consisting mainly of CO.10-13Chemical
looping gasification technology has many advantages, suchas the following: The oxygen carrier provides lattice oxygen
in the CLG process, which does not need to consume oxy-
gen and can be reused. So it reduces the reaction cost. Themain component of hydrogen-rich syngas produced by gasi-fication reaction is H
2and CO. And the CLG process
reduces the tar output and exergic loss, and improves the
calorific value of syngas.14-16

fuel reactor, as shown in Figure 1. The fuel is introducedReceived: 27 July 2020 Revised: 23 September 2020 Accepted: 5 October 2020

that is called oxygen carrier. The outlet gas from the fuelreactor contains CO, H
2,C O 2, and C nHm. After biomass
undergoes a chemical looping gasification reaction, the
carbon that is not fully reacted will form tar. Then, thereduced metal oxide (Me

reactor where the oxygen carrier is oxidized. The main

AND DEVICES
2.1 |Biomass raw materials
In this experiment, the biomass used was common pine
sawdust. The sample was dried in a drying box at 105/C14C
for 6 hours, and then 30 to 60 mesh pine sawdust parti-cles were sieved out by a sieve and loaded into a samplebag. The air was released from the sample bag, and it was
placed in a dry dish for later use.
The results of elemental analysis of sieved and dried
pine sawdust using an elemental analyzer are shown in

which coincided with the characteristic peaks ofNiFe

corresponding yield was 1.15 Nm3/kg.
The loaded NiO can form a unique NiFe 2O4spinel
structure with Fe 2O3. This spinel structure has a strong
oxygen release ability, which can make the oxygen car-rier reach a deeper degree of reduction in a shorter reac-

for CLG process. However, the loaded NiO will lose oxy-gen along with Fe
2O3during the reaction process. NiO
has apparent selectivity to H 2(H2+ NiO !Ni + H 2O).
Excessive loading of NiO will consume H 2in the synthe-

Biomass treatment and efficient energy recovery pose formidable challenges in solid waste management. The 
activation and functionalization of biochar-based catalysts (BC) derived from the co-pyrolysis of municipal 
sewage sludge (MSS) and cotton stalks (CS) were systematically investigated. These catalysts were then rein-
troduced into the same co-pyrolysis system of MSS and CS to evaluate their role in enhancing hydrogen-rich gas 
production efficiency through in-situ catalytic upgrading. The response surface methodology (RSM) was used to 
identify the best co-pyrolyzed biochar preparation conditions that would obtain the maximum specific surface 
area (SSA). BC with the maximum SSA was prepared at a pyrolysis te",280,"[ 0.03379524  0.00904058  0.00045445 ...  0.00427421 -0.01903033

of 6:4, and a residence time of 66 min. Potassium hydroxide (KOH), calcium nitrate anhydrous (Ca(NO 3)2), and 
nickel nitrate (Ni(NO 3)2) were used for the activation and functionalization of BC. Ni/Ca@KWBC with 30 % 
active components (15 % Ni and 15 % Ca) loading was the best catalyst with the highest H2 yield (5.03 mmol/g) 
and production rate (20.30 %). After reuse of the catalyst for five cycles, no serious reduction of H2 yield is found. 
Ni primarily promoted reforming reactions that directly increased the H2 yield, such as the water –gas shift re-
action and the steam –methane reforming reaction. Ca adsorbed CO2 and reduced the activation energy of the 
reaction, assisting in shifting the equilibrium of the water –gas shift reaction toward H2 generation. This closed- 
loop system uniquely repurposes biochar —a traditional low-value byproduct —as a catalyst, offering a novel 
pathway for integrated waste management and energy production.
1.Introduction

wastewater treatment, is chosen due to its high production. The annual 
global production of MSS has exceeded 40 million dry tons [2]. CS, an 
abundant agricultural residue, offer distinct advantages: their cellulose 
content (48.3 –52.7 wt%) and calorific value (18.2 –19.5 MJ/kg) surpass 
common biomass feedstocks like rice straw (16.8 MJ/kg) and wood 
chips (17.5 MJ/kg) [1]. Pyrolysis of biomass is mainly used for biochar 
and bio-oil production, but it is also effective for hydrogen-rich gas 
generation when combined with catalytic processes. While gasification 
is widely adopted for high-yield syngas production [3], this study ex-
plores catalytic pyrolysis as a sustainable alternative for hydrogen-rich syngas generation. However, Mono-biomass pyrolysis often yields 
hydrogen-rich gas with inconsistent energy density due to incomplete 
thermal decomposition and high tar formation [2]. Co-pyrolysis of MSS 
and other biomasses addresses this by leveraging synergistic interactions 
between nitrogen-rich sludge (promoting char reactivity) and 
cellulose-rich biomasses (enhancing porosity), achieving 10–30 % 
higher H₂ yields compared to",296,"[ 0.02878789  0.01403503  0.05945703 ... -0.0058108   0.00369131

Multiple catalysts have been used to enhance the efficiency of py-
rolysis based on bio-gas production. However, the introduction of 
diverse catalyst substrates may result in the generation of novel solid 
wastes characterized by more intricate structures [7]. Biochar-based 
catalysts (BC) have economical and technical advantages due to their 
abilities to be synthesized from low-cost biochar, which are abundant 
and easily processed [8]. This property contributes to an effective

BC were integrated into the co-pyrolysis system to facilitate in-situ tar 
cracking and hydrogen production, distinguishing this study from 
ex-situ approaches where catalysts are applied post-pyrolysis [9]. Lin 
[10] successfully prepared BC using MSS pyrolysis with a high iron 
content. This led to a hydrogen production increase of 0.48 m3/kg via 
the catalytic pyrolysis of MSS. Liu [11] successfully prepared MSS bio-
char catalysts that increased the pyrolysis gas yield nearly twofold 
compared to the control. In addition, the pyrolysis gas energy was only 
reduced by 8 % (from 8400 kJ to 7700 kJ) from cycle one to cycle five of 
the reuse cycle when using MSS biochar. BC are environmentally 
friendly and have excellent catalytic performance and reusability 
compared with conventional catalysts. Co-pyrolyzed BC refers to the 
solid residue generated from the simultaneous thermal decomposition of 
MSS and CS as defined in recent studies [7]. Co-pyrolyzed BC derived 
from MSS and CS blending serves as an advanced catalyst precursor due 
to its inherent metal species, high porosity, and minimized 
post-treatment requirements. The CS pore structure and the richness of 
the organic components in MSS may provide excellent properties for 
co-pyrolyzed biochar. This is because it provides sufficient sites and 
active components loading. However, the underutilization of 
co-pyrolyzed BC for in-situ catalysis despite its potential to mitigate 
energy density imbalances in single-biomass pyrolysis.
The performance of BC depends on the loading of active components, 
and activation and functionalization are key to catalyst modification. 
Yao [12] loaded Ni onto BC obtained by the pyrolysis of wheat straw, 
rice hulls, and cotton straw. The cotton straw BC showed the best cat-
alytic effect with the highest H2 concentration (64.02 vol%) and yield

hances the catalytic efficiency. Lu [13] prepared Fe/Ca/Ni@C and 
catalyzed the pyrolysis reaction of wheat straw, and the maximum H2 
yield was 281.29 mL/g when catalyzed with 5Fe1.5Ca0.8Ni@C. Ni and 
Ca have been shown to be suitable for catalyst modification. However, 
the performance of catalysts on BC is not clear, and separating them 
from the feedstock is difficult.
This study aims to develop a closed-loop system where self-generated 
BC, derived from MSS and CS co-pyrolysis, are activated and function -
alized to facilitate in-situ tar cracking and steam reforming, thereby 
enhancing hydrogen production efficiency. The optimal BC preparation 
conditions were explored, and the loading process of multiple active 
components was described. Additionally, the promotional effects of 
activation and functionalization on hydrogen-rich gas were analyzed, 
and the mechanisms of catalytic co-pyrolysis were revealed. This study 
provides theoretical support for the preparation of BC-based catalysts 
and hydrogen-rich gas yield improvements.
2.Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
The MSS feedstock used in this study was obtained from the sec-
ondary sedimentation tank of a wastewater treatment plant in Beijing, 
China. The CS feedstock was obtained from a cotton supplier based in 
Xinjiang Province, China. After naturally drying, the raw materials were 
crushed into 60-mesh particles and then dried in an oven at 105•C for 
24 h. Quartz sand (QS) was purchased from the Minghai Quartz Sand Co. 
Potassium hydroxide (KOH), calcium nitrate anhydrous (Ca(NO 3)2), 
nickel nitrate (Ni(NO 3)2), and aqueous ammonia were purchased from 
the Aladdin Chemistry Co. The chemical reagents used in the experi -
ments were of analytical grade unless otherwise stated.
2.2. Pyrolysis system
The pyrolysis systems details are shown in Figure S1. All experiments 
were conducted in a fixed bed electric furnace (GSL-1800X, HF-Kejing, 
China) using N2 (200 mL/min) flow as the carrier gas. The outle",487,"[ 0.03606857 -0.02412086  0.03006505 ... -0.00221276 -0.02393102

a gas cleaning device and a gas collection device. The condensable va-
pors were collected in a pre-cooled ( 5•C) conical flask using an ice- 
water bath, ensuring efficient phase separation. In this experiment, a 
5-g sample was loaded in an alumina boat and placed inside the heating 
zone. The carrier gas was injected into the reactor for 30 min to create an 
oxygen-free environment. The N2 flow was then terminated. To ensure 
thermal equilibration and minimize feedstock shock, the reactor was 
preheated to 40•C at 5 •C/min and held for 10 min (ASTM E1650 –04, 
2021). Biochar preparation involved heating to 900•C at 10 •C/min 
(86 min total) followed by 66 min of isothermal treatment to complete 
carbonization. Catalytic co-pyrolysis utilized 840•C (10 •C/min heating, 
80 min total) with 75 min of isothermal reaction, optimized for stable tar 
cracking and catalyst performance [14]. After termination of the py-
rolysis process, heating was stopped, and the system was returned to 
room temperature with a continued N2 flow (200 mL/min). The 
non-condensable gases (H₂, CO, CH₄, CO₂) were systematically collected 
using a gas-tight syringe connected to the reactor outlet. The solid res-
idue was then collected and weighed. All experiments were duplicated, 
and the values were reported as averages.
2.3. Preparation and characterization of the BC-based catalysts
2.3.1. Optimal BC preparation conditions
The response surface methodology (RSM) was used to arrange the 
experiments and analyze the BC specific surface area (SSA). The 
experimental optimization scheme was based on the Box–Behnken 
design (BBD) method. This method has high flexibility and can provide 
more experimental information using the same number of tests [1]. 
Compared with previous studies that primarily focused on optimizing 
pyrolysis parameters for single feedstocks [15], this study incorporates 
the CS-to-MSS mass ratio into t",477,"[ 0.0129684  -0.03793742  0.02466658 ... -0.00384092 -0.00106608

relatively novel perspective on co-pyrolysis interactions and their in-
fluence on biochar properties. Hence, the RSM was used to evaluate the 
effects of the pyrolysis temperature, the CS-to-MSS mass ratio, and the 
residence time —three independent variables determined in previous 
experiments [16]. Each independent variable was studied at three coded 
levels ( 1, 0, 1). For example, the pyrolysis temperature (X1) was 
500  900•C, the CS-to-MSS mass ratio (X2) was 20:80  60:40, and the 
residence time (X3) was 30  90 min. Table 1shows the 17 sets of ex-
periments that used the three-factor RSM. Fig. 2shows the actual and 
predicted values of the BC SSA under different parameter conditions. 
The SSA values of the prepared catalysts were analyzed using an auto-

The BC, which was identified using the RSM, served as a precursor 
for the subsequent activation and functionalization process.  Fig. 1
shows that the BC were washed with deionized water until a consistent 
pH level was achieved in the washing solution, after which they were 
dried at 105•C for 24h. The potassium-activated BC (KWBC) prepara -
tion involved BC (5g) activation using KOH (10g) under constant 
stirring in 200mL of deionized water for 12h at room temperature. This 
mixture was then thermally activated under N2 flow (200 mL/min) at

comprised of quartz (SiO 2), with the predominant crystalline phase 
identified by the characteristic peaks at 2 θ 20.9•and 26.7•[27]. The 
KOH activation caused a chemical reaction that led to the formation of 
K2CO3 [28], which was further converted into K2O and CO2 at 900•C 
[29]. The emergence of the peaks at 2 θ 44.5•, 51.9•, and 76.4•in the 
XRD patterns was attributed to the monomer Ni, signifying that the 
loading process effectively loaded Ni onto BC. This transformation was 
crucial as it represented the most active phase for catalytic cracking and 
reforming reactions [30]. Furthermore, the presence of CaO and CaCO 3 
was confirmed by the peaks at 2 θ 32.2•and 39.6•, respectively. This 
finding indicated that the active metal species were successfully incor -
porated into the structure, and CO₂ adsorption occurred on the catalyst 
surfaces.
A microscopic analysis of the catalysts was conducted to ascertain 
the surface morphologies and structural attributes (Fig. 4, Figure S3and 
Figure S5). The images revealed a uniform distribution of carbon and 
quartz across the catalyst surfaces. The QS exhibited a relatively 
compact structure with distinct characteristics of SiO2 (Figure S3(a)). 
After catalysis, pyrolytic carbon deposits were observed on the surface of 
QS (Figure S3(b)). The BC exhibited a well-defined pore structure with both the spherical lumpy structure of the MSS pyrolytic charcoal and the 
expanded lamellar structure of the CS pyrolytic charcoal (Fig. 4(a",401,"[ 0.04776006 -0.00960677  0.00525137 ...  0.00915256 -0.00124284

(b)). The regularly arranged pores in the CS had characteristic conduits 
or sieve-like tubes [31], which facilitated the interaction of reaction 
intermediates with the catalyst ’s active components, thereby partici -
pating in the catalytic reactions (Fig. 4(c) and (d)). KWBC activation 
enhanced pore development. The successful loading of the Ni and Ca 
active components onto the KWBC was confirmed by the compact and 
well-structured pore arrangement (Fig. 4(e), (g), and (i)). This structural 
enhancement was crucial for optimizing the catalyst ’s performance by 
providing a greater surface area for reactant adsorption and product 
desorption. EDX mapping (Figure S4) revealed uniform distribution of 
Ni and Ca across the catalyst surface, with no observable particle ag-
gregation. This homogeneous dispersion is critical for minimizing sin-
tering during repeated catalytic cycles, thereby maintaining long-term 
stability. Quantitatively, Table S3demonstrates close alignment be-
tween theoretical metal loadings (15% Ni and 15% Ca) and 
EDX-measured values (22.2 % Ni and 16.7 % Ca in Ni/Ca@KWBC), 
confirming precise metal incorporation [32].
The SSA of QS, BC, KWBC, Ni@KWBC, Ca@KWBC, Ni/Ca@KWBC 
were determined, and the compositions of the BC-based catalysts were 
quantified using ICP-OES, as depicted in Table 2. The BC exhibited an 
abundance of kalium (K), calcium (Ca), aluminum (Al), and iron (Fe).

KOH activation significantly enhanced the SSA of the KWBC 
(256.76 m2/g), which was 1.82-fold greater than raw BC (91.03 m2/g) 
and surpassed QS (0.269 m²/g) by nearly three orders of magnitude. The 
Ni/Ca@KWBC catalysts showed substantial increases in the content of 
Ni (19.63 %) and Ca (17.71 %) contents after further functionalization. 
The incorporation of these metals led to a reduction in the SSA to 
150.55 m2/g; nonetheless, this value was substantially greater than that 
of the unmodified BC. The results of the ICP-OES conclusively demon -
strated the successful loading of K, Ni and Ca onto the catalysts. This was 
conducive to contact between intermediate products and the catalytic 
active centers, thus facilitating the reforming conversion of the inter-
mediate products.
3.2. Effect of the catalysts on hydrogen-rich gas production
The hydrogen-rich gas yield and LHV were used as critical metrics to 
assess the pyrolytic product qualities. A comparative analysis of the 
hydrogen-rich gas yield was conducted to explore the effects of various 
catalysts, as shown in Fig. 5. In the absence of catalysts, the H2 yield was 
only 3.73 mmol/g. The use of the BC and KWBC as catalysts showed a 
modest improvement in H2 production, with a yield of 3.94 mmol/g 
(52.19 vol%) and 4.00 mmol/g (53.37 vol%), respectively. When Ni and

Jin [33]. Moreover, the H2 conversion reached 20.30 %, which was 
1.35-fold higher than that of the uncatalyzed process [34]. The pyrolysis 
gas composition was determined volumetrically for four principal 
components: H₂ (55.71 vol%), CO (23.07 vol%), CH₄ (6.49 vol%), and 
CO₂ (14.73 vol%), while trace hydrocarbons were omitted for calcula -
tions due to their low concentrations and limited contributions to gas 
energy properties. The H₂ content increased by 39% compared to our 
previous single-feedstock study and exceeded reported values for similar 
co-pyrolysis systems [6,14] . Furthermore, the pyrolysis gas obtained 
from the catalytic co-pyrolysis of CS and MSS exhibited a LHV of 11.91

MJ/Nm³ reported by Pelagalli et al. [35] for pyrolysis gas derived solely 
from MSS and ranking within the top 35% of values compiled in

crease in the reusable cycles of the spent catalysts. This result might 
have been due to the alternating reaction between CaO and CaCO 3 in the

pyrolysis of MSS and CS. Pyrolytic volatiles, which contained H2, CH4, 
CO, CO2, and bio-tar, were initially produced during the pyrolysis pro-
cess. These volatiles were then immediately adsorbed onto the catalyst

This is accomplished by reducing the activation energy [39]. Ni pri-
marily promotes reforming reactions that include the water –gas shift 
reaction (WGS, Reaction 4) and the steam –methane reforming reaction 
(SMR, Reaction 5) that directly increase the H2 yield [40]. CO and CH4 
yields are promoted through the Boudouard reaction (Reaction 2) and 
the methanation reaction (Reaction 3), which can help to move the 
equilibriums of the WGS and SMR reactions toward generating more H2 
due to increasing the reactant concentrations [41].

CO2, a major yield-limiting obstacle, also lowers the quality 
improvement of hydrogen-rich gas. Ca(NO 3)2 was converted into CaO 
during the catalyst preparation, as shown in Fig. 3. In addition to 
reducing the activation energy of the catalytic reaction, CaO can adsorb 
CO2 through the reaction shown in Reaction 6 until CaO is saturated. 
The CO2 composition decrease in the gas products directly increased the 
compositions of other gas products (including H2). Moreover, the 
decrease in CO2 concentration possibly assisted in shifting the equilib -
rium of the WGS reaction toward generating more H2 [42]. Additionally, 
the sintering of Ni formed on the catalysts caused the blockage of pores 
and active sites, leading t",272,"[ 0.04668501  0.00504237  0.02954094 ... -0.02164531 -0.00856589

Fig. 4(f), (h), and (j). Ca improves Ni dispersion and strengthens the 
interaction between support and Ni particles [33]. The alkali and alka-
line earth metals (AAEMs) and Fe in the BC and the active phases formed 
by their reaction with Ca and Ni (Ca2Fe2O5 and FeNi 3) further enhanced 
the efficiency of each catalytic reaction [43]. This can be seen in Fig. 3. 
In summary, the Ni/Ca@KWBC promoted the generation of 
hydrogen-rich gas and increased the H2 yield through various synergies.
The catalytic performance decrease after five reusable cycles indi-
cated that there was a certain inhibition effect during the catalytic 
process. This was primarily due to the conversion of some volatile 
organic compounds (VOCs) into amorphous carbon at high tempera -
tures, which limited the contact of volatile components with the active 
sites [44]. This led to a decrease in catalytic activity, as shown in Fig. 4

bon, but the catalysts would deactivate when the carbon deposition rate 
exceeds its decomposition rate. This will be the focus of our subsequent 
research.
4.Conclusions
In this study, BC-based catalysts were prepared by the activation and 
functionalization of biochar obtained from the co-pyrolysis of MSS and 
CS. K, Ca, and Ni were effectively loaded, and thus, the KWBC, 
Ni@KWBC, Ca@KWBC, and Ni/Ca@KWBC were successfully prepared. 
All the catalysts significantly promoted hydrogen-rich gas generation. 
The Ni/Ca@KWBC achieved the highest yields of H2 (5.03 mmol/g) and 
LHV (11.91 MJ/Nm3), thus significantly reducing the activation energy 
of the catalytic reaction and promoting a positive shift in the equilibrium 
reaction. Furthermore, after five cycling experiments of the catalysts, no 
serious reduction of hydrogen-rich gas yield and LHV occurred, indi-
cating that the catalyst structures obtained using biochar-based mate-
rials were stable, and the ac",261,"[ 0.03075295 -0.00372408  0.02465517 ...  0.00777826 -0.00196257

modification of the synthesis method for the NiFe 2O4 oxygen carrier, were specifically targeted to enhance the 
solid-solid reaction activity. The results indicate that the reactivity can be significantly improved by synthesizing 
NiFe 2O4 using the sol-gel method with varying ratios of citric acid. Specifically, a citric acid ratio of 1:3 
demonstrated a substantial hydrogen gas yield of 0.032 Nm3/kg, although CO remained the predominant

carbide slag exhibited a pronounced synergistic effect with the NiFe 2O4 oxygen carrier, resulting in a H2 gas yield 
improvement that exceeded fivefold compared to the NiFe 2O4 sample alone. The formation of the Ca2Fe2O5

1.Introduction
Hydrogen is considered an ideal energy carrier due to its high energy 
density and clean combustion characteristics. However, the majority of 
current hydrogen production relies on conventional fossil fuels, such as 
coal gasification, oil reforming, and steam methane reforming of CH4 
(Ren et al., 2020 ; Valizadeh et al., 2022 ). These processes are associated 
with significant carbon emissions, contributing to global warming. In 
contrast, biomass is a carbon-neutral resource, offering a sustainable 
alternative for hydrogen production (Hu et al., 2021 ; Nguyen et al., 
2021 ). In traditional biomass gasification technologies, a gasification 
agent containing molecular oxygen, such as air, steam (H2O), pure oxygen (O2), or carbon dioxide (CO 2),",249,"[ 0.01818271  0.0016141   0.01425969 ...  0.00182656 -0.00715657

"E:\\PINNs-Research\\Searched Articles\\Biochar chemical-looping gasification for hydrogen-rich syngas production in solid-solid reaction O, H and CaO of carbide slag effect NiFe2O4.pdf",1,4,"is typically required. However, 
these agents are associated with several drawbacks, including the 
inevitable formation of tar and high costs, which significantly decrease 
the quality and efficiency of the gasification process (Chen et al., 2019a ; 
Sun et al., 2020 ). Biomass chemical-looping gasification represents a 
promising technology for the production of high-quality hydrogen-rich 
syngas. In chemical-looping processes, the lattice oxygen within a solid 
oxygen carrier is utilized as the gasification agent. This oxygen carrier 
serves multiple essential functions in biomass chemical-looping gasifi -
cation, including providing an oxygen source, acting as a heat carrier, 
and functioning as a catalyst (Gulec and Okolie, 2024 ; Yu et al., 2020 ). 
As a result, chemical-looping gasification emerges as an attractive

2technology for the efficient utilization of biomass.
In biomass chemical-looping gasification (CLG), the oxygen carrier 
circulates between a fuel reactor and an air reactor (Huang et al., 2020 ; 
Liu et al., 2018a , 2023a ). In the fuel reactor, the oxygen carrier partially 
oxidizes biomass to produce syngas. In the air reactor, the reduced ox-
ygen carrier is re-oxidized by air to replenish its lattice oxygen. There -
fore, the selection of an appropriate oxygen carrier is crucial for the 
production quality of hydrogen-rich syngas, which remains one of the 
key challenges. A suitable oxygen carrier should possess the following 
characteristics (Purnomo et al., 2021 ; Imtiaz et al., 2016 ): 1) high 
oxygen-loading and oxygen-transport capacity; 2) good reactivity and 
selectivity; 3) high thermal stability; 4) economic viability and envi-
ronmental friendliness. Many transition metal oxides, such as those 
based on Fe, Cu, Mn, Ni, and Co, have been extensively investigated as 
oxygen carriers. These metals and their oxides exhibit favorable redox 
properties and have been widely used in various chemical-looping 
processes (Miao et al., 2022 ; Goel et al., 2022 ; Xu et al., 2022 ). How-
ever, single metal oxygen carriers exhibit shortcomings for 
hydrogen-rich syngas production. For example, Ni-based and Co-based 
oxygen carriers are expensive and face thermodynamic limitations. 
Cu-based and Mn-based oxygen carriers tend to aggregate and suffer 
from poor thermal stability at high temperatures. Fe-based oxygen 
carriers have lower oxygen transport capacity, lower reactivity, and 
weak reducibility. In contrast, multi-metal oxygen carriers demonstrate 
better reactivity compared with single metal oxygen carriers due to their 
ability to produce synergistic effects (Liu et al., 2021 ).
Numerous studies have confirmed that NiFe 2O4 is an ideal oxygen 
carrier for hydrogen-rich syngas production in biomass chemical- 
looping gasification. NiFe 2O4 serves as both a gasification agent and a 
catalyst, converting biomass into hydrogen-rich syngas. Huang et al.

transformation in NiFe 2O4. Their findings indicate that the chemical 
reaction interface is fixed on the surface of NiFe 2O4, and the concen -
tration gradient between the surface and the bulk drives the trans -
mission of lattice oxygen, thereby facilitating the reduction or oxidation 
of NiFe 2O4. Chen et al. (2019b) reported the performance of MFe 2O4 (M 
Cu, Ba, Ni, and Co) oxygen carriers in biomass chemical looping 
gasification. These oxygen carriers exhibited good oxygen trans -
ferability due to the synergistic effects of the different metal compo -
nents. Specifically, NiFe 2O4 demonstrated the highest lattice oxygen 
release, reaching approximately 27.32%. This oxygen carrier showed 
superior performance for biochar gasification compared to a mixture of 
Fe2O3 and NiO (Huang et al., 2017 ). Zheng et al. (2020) investigated the 
effects of different operating conditions on syngas production and tar 
reduction in biomass chemical-looping gasification. Their results indi-
cated that a mass ratio of NiFe 2O4 to biomass of 1.25 achieved the 
highest total gas yield of 1.05 Nm3/kg and the lowest tar content of 3.5 
g/Nm3. Yan et al. (2021) reported that NiFe 2O4 exhibited good stability 
and activity during redox cycles, with a gasification efficiency that 
remained above 70.49%. This performance was attributed to the ability 
of NiFe 2O4 to promote gasification and tar cracking, resulting in lower 
activation energy and higher syngas production.
However, enhancing the hydrogen content in syngas is necessary, 
which represents another challenge in biomass chemical-looping gasi-
fication. To improve the hydrogen content, H2O is considered beneficial 
because it can oxidize the oxygen carrier, thereby producing H2 (Lin 
et al., 2021 ). The use of H2O as a gasification agent can increase oper-
ating costs. Many studies have demonstrated that CaO exhibits better 
reaction performance and improves the quality of purified hydrogen gas 
(Udomsirichakorn and Salam, 2014 ). Similar results have been reported 
in the literature. Wei et al. (2022) investigated the modification of Fe2O3 
with CaO, CeO 2, NiO, and Co2O3, respectively. The results indic",539,"[ 0.04680763  0.01326774  0.02147939 ...  0.02088175 -0.02151525

"E:\\PINNs-Research\\Searched Articles\\Biochar chemical-looping gasification for hydrogen-rich syngas production in solid-solid reaction O, H and CaO of carbide slag effect NiFe2O4.pdf",2,3,"ated that 
CaO exhibited the best reaction performance among the exogenous 
metals tested. This superior performance is attributed to the carbonation 
of CaO sorbents, which shifts the chemical-looping gasification reaction 
equilibrium towards hydrogen production. In our previous work (Liu et al., 2024 ), the addition of CaO to NiAl 2O4 was studied for 
hydrogen-rich syngas production. The results demonstrated that CaO 
effectively prevented Ni segregation and reduced the sintering of 
NiAl 2O4. Recently, Wang et al. (2023) reported a novel double-effect 
oxygen carrier designed to further enhance the quality of syngas. This 
oxygen carrier was composed of a Cu-Mn oxide and CaO, prepared by 
mechanical mixing. The results showed that the addition of CaO 
improved both the oxygen release velocity and the oxygen absorption 
velocity of the active phase of the double-effect oxygen carrier. The 
double-effect oxygen carrier in chemical-looping gasification not only 
enhances the reactivity of the oxygen carrier but also improves the 
quality of the syngas produced. However, the use of CaO increases the 
cost of chemicals. Carbide slag is an industrial waste produced during 
the preparation of polyvinyl chloride, and its major component is Ca 
(OH) 2. This material can be considered as an oxygen carrier, hydrogen 
carrier, and in-situ carbon capture agent. As reported by Yang et al. 
(2023) , carbide slag was used as the oxygen carrier, hydrogen carrier, 
and in-situ carbon capture agent in lignite chemical-looping gasification 
for hydrogen-rich syngas production. The results obtained indicated that 
hydrogen-rich syngas production was achieved at 650 •C with a molar 
ratio of lignite to carbide slag greater than 1:5.
Based on previous studies and analyses, the combination of NiFe 2O4 
oxygen carrier and carbide slag as a double-oxygen carrier has the po-
tential to enhance both the hydrogen content and the reactivity of 
NiFe 2O4. However, the combined effects of NiFe 2O4 and carbide slag on 
reaction behavior remain poorly understood. In the current work, bio-
char was selected instead of biomass to avoid the complexity associated 
with biomass (volatile matter,",506,"[ 0.03339433  0.01110331  0.01551571 ...  0.00779402  0.01209188

"E:\\PINNs-Research\\Searched Articles\\Biochar chemical-looping gasification for hydrogen-rich syngas production in solid-solid reaction O, H and CaO of carbide slag effect NiFe2O4.pdf",2,4,"tar, and char). While the reaction activity 
of the solid-solid reaction between biochar and the oxygen carrier is 
relatively low, it is crucial for converting biomass into hydrogen-rich 
syngas in chemical-looping gasification. Therefore, the influence of 
various reaction parameters, such as the modification of NiFe 2O4, the 
mass ratio of NiFe 2O4 to carbide slag, and the reaction temperature, 
were investigated in the solid-solid reaction. A series of characterization 
tools were employed to analyze both fresh and spent NiFe 2O4 and car-
bide slag. Concurrently, combined correlation analysis was conducted to 
elucidate the potential reaction behavior of NiFe 2O4 and carbide slag in 
the solid-solid reaction. Concurrently, combined correlation analysis 
was conducted to elucidate the potential reaction behavior of NiFe 2O4 
and carbide slag in the solid-solid reaction.
2.Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of NiFe 2O4 oxygen carrier
The NiFe 2O4 oxygen carrier was synthesized using the sol-gel 
method with Ni(NO 3)2⋅6H2O and Fe(NO 3)3⋅9H2O as raw materials. 
The detailed preparation process has been previously reported (Liu 
et al., 2023a ). In the sol-gel method, as illustrated in Fig. 1, the nitrates 
initially undergo hydrolysis, followed by polycondensation in the pres-
ence of citric acid, which acts as a complexing agent. The resulting gel is 
subsequently aged to produce the NiFe 2O4 precursor. As reported by 
Huang et al. (2024) ., the ratio of citric acid can significantly influence 
the characteristics of the oxygen carriers. This is because the citric acid 
content affects the stability of the complex, thereby controlling the 
progress of the reaction and the formation of the product. The synthe -
sized process is as follow: the raw materials were mixed and stirred at 
80 •C, and the citric acid solution is added to metals solution with mole 
ratio including 1:1, 1:1.5, 1:2, 1:2.5 and 1:3, respectively. The mixture 
solution was continuously stirred at 80 •C to obtain a wet gel. After that, 
the wet gel is dried and calcined at 800 •C for 3h in air condition. Then, 
obtained oxygen carriers are crushed and sieved into particles of 
106–120 μm.C. Liu et al",560,"[ 0.02793224 -0.00070171 -0.00471617 ...  0.01728973  0.00063657

Straw (Chengdu, China) is used as a biomass source. Its preparation 
method and analysis (ultimate and proximate) correspond to our pre-
vious report (Liu et al., 2023b ). Carbide slag (Nanjing, China) is used as 
oxygen, hydrogen and in-situ carbon capture agent. Its composition has 
been analyzed by XRF as shown in Table 1. The carbide slag is sieved on 
to particles of 106–120 μm.

different ratio of citric acid, and carbide slag using X-ray diffraction

with a length of 400 mm and an inner diameter of 20 mm. A mixture of 
the oxygen carrier and biochar sample, supported on quartz wool, was 
loaded onto a porous plate positioned 200 mm from the bottom of the 
reactor. The reactivity of the NiFe 2O4 oxygen carrier with biochar was 
investigated under three distinct conditions in solid-solid reactions. 
Firstly, the reactivity of NiFe 2O4 oxygen carriers synthesized with 
different ratios of citric acid (1:1, 1:1.5, 1:2, 1:2.5, and 1:3) was evalu -
ated with biochar at a mass ratio of 1:1 (0.2 g:0.2 g) at 800 •C for a 
reaction time of 1 h. Secondly, the influence of varying mass ratios of 
NiFe 2O4 oxygen carrier, biochar, and carbide slag was examined. The 
ratios tested were 0.2g:0.2g:1g, 0.2g:0.2g:2g, 0.2g:0.2g:3g, 
0.2g:0.2g:4g, and 0.2g:0.2g:5g. The mixture samples were stirred for 
10min and then analyzed at 800 •C for a reaction time of 1h. Third",393,"[ 0.03312875 -0.01517495  0.02609704 ...  0.0051439  -0.00753311

effect of different reaction temperatures (650 –850 •C) on the reactivity was studied, with a reaction time maintained at 1h. After cooling and 
drying, the produced gases were detected using a thermal conductivity 
detector (TCD) in conjunction with an online gas chromatograph (Agi-
lent 7890), which quantified H₂, CO, CO2, and CH4. For the analysis of 
H2, CO, and CH4, a TDX-01 column was selected, while a Porapak Q 
column was used for the analysis of CO2.

successful synthesis of the material using the sol-gel method with 
varying citric acid ratios. The (311) crystal plane of NiFe 2O4 was 
selected for grain size analysis. The grain size was calculated using the 
Scherrer formula, and the results are presented in Table 2. The trend 
indicated that the grain size decreased with increasing citric acid ratio. 
The smallest grain size was 7.20 nm at a citric acid ratio of 1:3, sug-
gesting potential anti-sintering ability. Liu et al. (Liu et al.). studied the 
synthesis of NiFe 2O4 with different citric acid ratios and observed that 
the grain size initially decreased and then increased with increasing 
citric acid content. This trend is opposite to our findings, likely due to 
the lower calcination temperature used in our study (800 •C) compared 
to the reference (1000 •C). Higher calcination temperatures generally

The carbide slag was also characterized using XRD, as shown in 
Fig. 2. The results indicate that only the peaks corresponding to Ca(OH) 2 
were detected, suggesting that Ca(OH) 2 is the predominant component 
of the carbide slag. However, other components such as SiO2, Al2O3, 
MgO, K2O, etc., were not detected due to their low concentrations in the 
carbide slag.
3.2. H2-TPR analysis
The H2-TPR profiles of fresh NiFe 2O4 oxygen carriers synthesized 
with different ratios of citric acid are presented in Fig. 3. Generally, the 
reduction temperature of Ni is in the range of 400–580 •C, corresponding to the reduction of NiO to metallic Ni (Ni2⁺→Ni0). The 
NiFe 2O4 sample with a citric acid ratio of 1:3 exhibited the lowest 
reduction temperature of approximately 425.8 •C. This indicates that 
the NiFe 2O4 oxygen carrier with a citric acid ratio of 1:3 has higher 
activity for hydrogen generation, primarily due to the catalytic role of 
Ni. As the reduction temperature increases, Fe2O3 is reduced to Fe3O4, 
and further reduction to metallic Fe (Fe3⁺→Fe2⁺ and Fe3⁺→Fe0) occurs 
above 600 •C (Wei et al., 2014 ).
In this process, the H2-TPR profiles indicate that the NiFe 2O4 oxygen 
carrier with a cit",383,"[ 0.01133582 -0.0106222   0.00298236 ...  0.02133281  0.01851622

"E:\\PINNs-Research\\Searched Articles\\Biochar chemical-looping gasification for hydrogen-rich syngas production in solid-solid reaction O, H and CaO of carbide slag effect NiFe2O4.pdf",4,2,"ric acid ratio of 1:3 exhibits the lowest reduction tem-
perature (597.1 •C) for the reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4. This reduction 
temperature is significantly lower than that reported in previous work 
(Liu et al., 2023b ), where Fe2O3 was used as an oxygen carrier for 
hydrogen-rich syngas production, and the reduction of Fe3O4 to Fe was 
observed at a much higher temperature (841.5 •C). The lower reduction 
temperature observed in the current study suggests that the lattice ox-
ygen in NiFe 2O4 with a citric acid ratio of 1:3 is more readily released, 
facilitating the gasification of biochar. The reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 
is crucial for biochar gasification, as it provides the necessary lattice 
oxygen for the gasification process. The findings suggest that the 
NiFe 2O4 oxygen carrier with a citric acid ratio of 1:3 is highly effective 
for biochar gasification due to its enhanced ability to release lattice 
oxygen at a lower temperature. This characteristic is advantageous for 
improving the efficiency and reducing the energy consumption of the 
gasification process.
3.3. BET and SEM analysis

slag are presented in Table S1. For the NiFe 2O4 oxygen carrier, the

"E:\\PINNs-Research\\Searched Articles\\Biochar chemical-looping gasification for hydrogen-rich syngas production in solid-solid reaction O, H and CaO of carbide slag effect NiFe2O4.pdf",4,3,"sing citric acid ratio. The maximum relative surface area (12.777 
m2/g) was achieved with a citric acid ratio of 1:3, indicating a trend 
towards increased surface area with higher citric acid ratios. This trend 
can be explained by the SEM results shown in Fig. 4(a)–(e). The surface 
elements of O, Ni, and Fe are uniformly distributed across different citric 
acid ratios. However, the surface morphology varies significantly. At a 
citric acid ratio of 1:1 (Fig. 4(a)), the surface appears compact. As the 
citric acid ratio increases, the surface becomes looser, but larger parti-
cles are observed, suggesting potential agglomeration. The most uniform 
and smallest particle sizes are observed at citric acid ratios of 1:2.5 and 
1:3. This particle morphology contributes to the higher relative surface 
area observed at these higher citric acid ratios.
For the carbide slag, the elements O and Ca exhibit uniform distri -
butions, as shown in Fig. 4(f). The surface morphology of the carbide 
slag displays partial porosity rather than a compact structure. Fig. S2
presents the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms for both NiFe 2O4 and 
carbide slag. The results indicate a hysteresis loop in the P/P₀ range of 
0.95 –1 for both materials. The hysteresis loop type for NiFe 2O4 is clas-
sified as H2(b), which corresponds to a",339,[0.0231982  0.00757033 0.03672735 ... 0.03168046 0.02266103 0.01672719]

contrast, the hysteresis loop type for carbide slag is H3, indicating a flat 
slit and wedge-shaped pore structure.
3.4. XPS analysis
The surface oxygen characteristics of NiFe 2O4 at various citric acid 
ratios, as well as carbide slag, are presented in Fig. 5. For the NiFe 2O4 
oxygen carriers, the surface oxygen species can be categorized into three 
distinct types: lattice oxygen (OL), oxygen-containing groups (Os), and 
physically adsorbed oxygen (Oad), with binding energies of approxi -
mately 530eV, 531eV, and 532eV, respectively (Sutthiumporn et al., 
2012 ; Qin et al., 2015 ; Song et al., 2016 ). The binding energies of OL and 
Os exhibit negligible shifts, whereas Oad displays slight variations at 
different citric acid ratios, as detailed in Table 3. The structural 
configuration of the NiFe 2O4 oxygen carrier can influence the shift in the 
position of Oad due to the provision of diverse adsorption sites. The ratio

5of Os/(OL Os) serves as an indicator of the oxygen vacancy content, 
which plays a crucial role in chemical looping gasification. As indicated 
in Table 3, the oxygen vacancy content is 0.18 and 0.19 at citric acid 
ratios of 1:1 and 1:1.5, respectively. A slight enhancement in the oxygen 
vacancy content is observed at citric acid ratios of 1:2, 1:2.5, and 1:3. 
However, the increase in oxygen vacancy content is minimal and can be 
considered negligible. Therefore, the citric acid ratio does not exert a 
significant influence on the oxygen vacancy content for NiFe 2O4 oxygen 
carriers. For carbide slag, the surface oxygen species is solely Os, with a 
binding energy of 531.42 eV.

increasing citric acid ratio. Specifically, the citric acid ratio of 1:3 ex-
hibits the minimum value of 0.77. In general, the octahedral structure of 
Ni2⁺ is less stable. This suggests that the NiFe 2O4 structure is more stable 
at a lower ratio of Ni2⁺(O)/Ni2⁺(T). The results indicate that the citric

3.5.1. The effect of citric acid ratio on modified NiFe 2O4
The NiFe 2O4 oxygen carriers synthesized with different citric acid

solid reaction, as shown in Fig. 6(a)–(b). In the solid-solid reaction, 
CO is the predominant gas, constituting over 60% of the total gas 
composition, while H₂ accounts for approximately 10%. As reported in 
previous studies (Liu et al., 2022 ), the production of CO during the 
solid-solid reaction is primarily attributed to the oxidation by lattice 
oxygen. Compared to fresh NiFe 2O4 oxygen carriers, all spent NiFe 2O4 
oxygen carriers exhibit two types of surface oxygen species, namely 
oxygen-containing groups (Os) and physically adsorbed oxygen (Oad), as

plays a crucial role in the oxidation of biochar to produce CO and CO₂ 
during the solid-solid reactions. As shown in Fig. 7, Fe3O4 and Ni3Fe

oxygen release process of NiFe 2O4, the oxygen carrier initially releases 
lattice oxygen, forming the intermediate Fe2O3 phase. Subsequently, 
Fe2O3 further releases lattice oxygen to oxidize biochar, ultimately 
transforming into the Fe3O4 phase, as previously reported (Liu et al.,

oxygen and hydrogen, and the generated CaO acts as an in-situ capture 
agent to adsorb CO2, thereby enhancing the H2 gas yield. However, the

8candidate due to its lattice oxygen and oxygen vacancies, which pro-
mote solid-solid reactions and enhance the yields of CO and H2 gases. At 
the same time, the detection of a higher amount of CaCO 3 phase in the 
blend with 5g of carbide slag could lead to the encapsulation of active 
phases. Under this condition, the H2 gas yield shows less increase.
For further discussion of the blend effect of carbide slag, the gas 
composition and gas yield results of carbide slag reacting with biochar 
are shown in Fig. 10(a)–(b). For the gas composition, the ratio of H2 gas 
is enhanced, while the CO2 gas ratio is decreased. This is attributed to 
carbide slag acting as both an oxygen carrier and a hydrogen carrier, 
providing oxygen and hydrogen for the reaction. The reduction in CO2 
ratio is due to its capture by the generated CaO. As shown in Fig. 10(c), 
the presence of CaO and CaCO 3 phases is detected across all different 
carbide slag masses, indicating that oxygen and hydrogen are released at 
800 •C. The trend of gas yield is",266,"[ 0.02908135  0.01773712 -0.00431833 ... -0.01499194  0.02330269

However, the gas yield is lower compared to that of NiFe 2O4 and bio-
char. The results indicate that the effectiveness of lattice oxygen con-
version is higher in carbide slag, as previously reported (Song et al., 
2024 ; Cheng et al., 2017 ). As shown in Fig. S5, the solid-solid reaction 
results are displayed for three different systems: NiFe 2O4 and biochar, 
(NiFe 2O4carbide slag) and biochar, and carbide slag and biochar. The 
results indicate that the combined gas yield from NiFe 2O4 and biochar 
(as described in Section 3.5.1 ) and from carbide slag and biochar is 
lower than that from the blend of (NiFe 2O4carbide slag) and biochar. 
This suggests a synergistic effect between carbide slag and NiFe 2O4. The 
oxygen and hydrogen produced by carbide slag are activated by the 
NiFe 2O4 oxygen carrier, thereby increasing the yield of hydrogen-rich 
syngas. Wang et al. (2023) . reported a novel double-effect oxygen car-
rier composed of CuxMn3-xO4 and CaO for chemical looping gasification.

carrier. This finding may explain the observed synergistic effect between 
carbide slag and NiFe 2O4.
Based on the analysis of carbide slag and NiFe 2O4 oxygen carrier in 
solid-solid reaction, the possible mechanism is shown as Fig. 11. In this

reactions R5-R7. While the reaction of biochar with an oxidized state 
oxygen carrier (Fe3O4) is represented by reactions R8-R10. The forma -
tion CaO and Ca2Fe2O5 captures CO2 to improve hydrogen purity, as

the release efficiency of oxygen and hydrogen from carbide slag and 
NiFe 2O4. Based on the results presented in Section 3.5.2 , the combina -
tion of 4 g of carbide slag with NiFe 2O4 was further investigated over a 
temperature range of 650–850 •C. For the gas composition results shown 
in Fig. 12(a), the ratios of H2 and CO gases increased with the rising 
reaction temperature, with H2 and CO being the major products in the 
solid-solid reaction. For the gas yield results shown in Fig. 12(b), the 
yields of all gases increased, particularly those of H2 and CO, which were 
highest at 800 •C and 850 •C. This indicates that oxygen and hydrogen 
are more readily released at higher reaction temperatures, thereby 
enhancing the conversion efficiency in the solid-solid reaction. How-
ever, the increase in H2 gas yield was less pronounced from 800 •C to

10In the gas yield results, the H2 gas yield shows less increase at 850 •C. 
Based on the phase analysis at 850 •C, the CaCO 3 phase is more prom -
inently detected, which could imply that the active sites of Ni3Fe are 
occupied.
Based on the above study, the relationships between reaction pa-
rameters and gas composition in solid-solid reactions were further 
investigated. The Pearson correlation coefficient was employed as a 
method to analyze the associations between various parameters (Ayub 
et al., 2023 ; Kartal and Ozveren, 2022 ). In this work, parameters 
including Reaction Temperature (RT), Carbide Slag (CS), Particle Size 
(PS), Surface Area (SA), Oxygen Vacancies (Ov), and the ratio of Ni(O) to 
total oxygen (O/T) were correlated with the yields of H2, CO, CO2, and 
CH4, as shown in Fig. 14. The results indicate that RT and CS are the 
dominant parameters influencing gas production in solid-solid re-
actions. For H2 and CO2 gas production, CS is a more significant 
parameter than RT, which can be attributed to the exothermic nature of 
H2 and CO2 generation reactions. Additionally, SA and Ov are identified 
as other important parameters affecting the gas yields. Generally, Sur-
face Area (SA) and Oxygen Vacancies (Ov) are known to influence 
gas-solid reactio",327,"[ 0.01931961 -0.01038897  0.01561773 ... -0.00809554  0.02340789

"E:\\PINNs-Research\\Searched Articles\\Biochar chemical-looping gasification for hydrogen-rich syngas production in solid-solid reaction O, H and CaO of carbide slag effect NiFe2O4.pdf",10,2,"ns. The results indicate that H₂ and CO₂ are not directly 
produced via solid-solid reactions but rather through reforming pro-
cesses. Compared to CO production, Reaction Temperature (RT) is a 
more significant parameter than SA. CO is the major product in 
solid-solid reactions due to the gasification of biochar by oxygen 
released from NiFe 2O4 and carbide slag. However, temperature is a 
critical factor affecting oxygen release. On the other hand, CO formation 
via biochar oxidation is an endothermic reaction. The SA and Ov pa-
rameters show less importance for CO production, indicating that CO is 
the primary product in solid-solid reactions. CH4 exhibits similar results 
to CO. For the parameters SA and O/T, they show negative correlations 
with H2, CO, CO2, and CH4. This suggests that these parameters are not 
beneficial for gas production in solid-solid reactions.
4.Conclusion
The solid-solid reaction has been investigated for the production of 
hydrogen-rich syngas in the context of chemical looping biochar gasi-
fication. In the present study, carbide slag is utilized as an oxygen car-
rier, hydrogen carrier, and in-situ carbon capture agent. It is integrated 
with NiFe 2O4 to form a dual-functional oxygen carrier system, which is 
designed to enhance the reaction rate in solid-solid reactions and augment the yie",300,"[ 0.03406386  0.00589523  0.00141696 ...  0.00099628  0.00919247

NiFe 2O4 oxygen carrier was synthesized by sol-gel method. The citric 
acid ratio affect characteristic of NiFe 2O4 oxygen carrier. The citric acid 
ratio (1:3) shows the higher content of oxygen vacancies, lower reduc -
tion temperature and higher relative surface area. The result exhibit the 
greater H2 gas yield (0.032Nm3/kg). However, the H2 gas yield displays 
minimal deviation in solid-solid reaction at different ratios of citric acid. 
The carbide slag addition shows obvious enhance for H2 gas yield, and it 
blend mass 4g displays great. This enhancement in H2 gas yield is over 
fivefold compared to the NiFe 2O4 sample. It is attributed to the syner -
gistic effect between carbide slag and NiFe 2O4 oxygen carrier. Notable, 
the formation of Ca2Fe2O5 phase contributes to the enhanced activity of 
hydrogen production in the solid-solid reaction. In different reaction

ture. Based on Pearson correlation coefficient calculation, the reaction

production. Additionally, H2 production is attributed to reforming pro-
cesses, while CO p",322,"[ 0.02358082 -0.02095942 -0.0003251  ...  0.01411793 -0.00707072

considered for hydrogen-rich syngas production. Specifically, the study 
will focus on the potential interactions between the components of 
carbide slag to further enhance the reactivity of NiFe 2O4.

to global warming, climate change and energy security issues. As a
consequence, many researches and developments worldwide are real-
ized to encourage the use of renewable and sustainable energy sources.
Hydrogen being a pollution-free energy carrier is expected to be the
most promising source to replace fossil fuel employed both in power
generation and transportation sectors [1–3]. However, it is not naturally
available in suf ﬁcient quantities and also needs to be synthetically
produced. Currently, there are a number of energy sources and technolo-
gies to produce hydrogen. But about 96% of the hydrogen for commercial
use is produced from fossil fuels, nearly 50% of which is contributed by
natural gas, primarily via steam methane reforming [4], which is a fossil
fuel based process. Biomass is conside red as the potential substitute forthe depleting fossil fuels [5]. It is also accepted as the greatest promise
due to its availability everywhere in the world [2].
The technologies available for conversion of biomass into hydrogen-
rich gas can be classi ﬁed into biological and thermo-chemical methods
[6–10]. Biomass steam gasi ﬁcation, as one of the thermo-chemical
methods, has been perceived as an attr active process for producing syn-
gas rich in hydrogen [11–16]. Howe",284,"[ 0.01379577  0.01811202  0.02232385 ... -0.00852228 -0.02076907

from the problem of unpleasant tar and CO 2formed within the process.
The use of calcium oxide (CaO) duall y acknowledged as a tar reforming
catalyst and a CO 2sorbent has currently gained lots of attention due to
its cheapness and abundance [17]. Its role in catalytic reforming of tar
not only reduces the tar amount in the product gas but also enhances
the total gas and hydrogen yields [1,17,18] . Similarly, another role in
removing CO 2from the gasiﬁ cation reaction as soon as it is formed alters
the equilibrium composition of the produced gas and promotes the pro-duction of gas rich in hydrogen [3,17].H o w e v e r ,t h ed e a c t i v a t i o no fC a O

(CaO-CLG), basically aimed for hydrogen production with in situ CO 2
capture, is playing an important role.
The CaO-CLG concept was initiated through the CO 2acceptor pro-
cess and has currently been developed through the HyPr-RING process,
the ZECA process, the ALSTOM process, and the AGC process [20].
Nevertheless, some of these processes are not considered as environ-
mentally sustainable hydrogen production processes due to their
dependence on fossil fuel. Moreover, the processes were designed to
operate at high pressures and/or temperatures and some of them
were designed with multiple-loop con ﬁguration that causes high opera-
tional complexity as well as high capital cost. Although these demerits arechallenging for the operation of chemical looping process for continuous
hydrogen production, no formation of CO
2and tar observed in some
previous processes, such as the HyPr-RING, seems to be advantageous.This shows that each technology has its own pros and cons. To facilitate

experimental studies have been conducted using the same CaO-CLGsystem but separately focused on individual component and sub-
process of the system. Overall investigation on the whole looping system
is still lacking not only in this CaO-CLG system but also in other CaO-CLGsystems that are scarcely found in open literature. This provides an oppor-
tunity for the present study to ful ﬁll the knowledge gap on the CaO-CLG
system which is currently available only in R&D stage [23].

2.1. Biomass feedstock
Pine wood sawdust with particle size of 0.425 –0.5 mm was used as
the feedstock. The proximate analysis of the sawdust was conducted fol-
lowing ASTM standard test methods. The higher heating value (HHV)
analysis was performed according to the British Standard No. BS4379
using a bomb calorimeter (Parr 6100). The carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen
and sulfur contents (C, H, N and S) in the sawdust were determined
using an elemental analyzer (Leco CHN-1000 and Leco SC-432) and

proximate analysis results are presented in Table 1 .
2.2. Bed materials
Silica sand (mean particle size 0.25 –0.3 mm) with apparent density
of 2300 kg/m3and calcined limestone (mean particle size 0.25 –0.3 mm)
were used as bed materials for the Sand/CaO-CLG system. Prior to
starting each experiment, the sized limestone (apparent density
2600 kg/m3) was calcined in a muf ﬂe oven at 900 °C for 3 h and then
gradually cooled down by purging the atmosphere in the oven withnitrogen gas to avoid a carbonation reaction of calcined limestone. The
chemical composition of calcined limestone is presented in Table 2 .
The change in particle size of limestone after calcination was found tobe very small, but its weight loss through calcination was about 42.7%.
2.3. Facilities and procedures
Fig. 1 shows the schematic drawing of the chemical looping gasi ﬁca-
tion system developed by Acharya et al. [21,22] and used in this exper-
imental study. The unique tailor-made con ﬁguration of this system
mainly consists of a bubbling ﬂuidized-bed gasi ﬁer with a height of
450 mm, a circulating ﬂuidized-bed regenerator with a height of
1500 mm and a bubbling ﬂuidized-bed loopseal with a height of
135 mm. Electric heaters with a total capacity of 12 kW were mounted
alongside these reactors and used to externally heat the system. All ex-
periments were carried out at atmospheric pressure. Before startingeach run, about 1.5 –2 kg of either fresh CaO (calcined limestone) or
sand with a mean particle size of 0.275 mm was manually fed into thebed of the reactors for use as bed material. The biomass feedstock was
loaded into the hopper. After loading the gasi ﬁer, all the heaters as
well as the electric steam generator a nd steam/air superheater/preheater
were turned on.",482,"[ 0.00351346  0.03155989  0.01816714 ... -0.00579965 -0.00399701

E:\\PINNs-Research\\Searched Articles\\CaO-based chemical looping gasification of biomass for hydrogen-enriched gas production with in situ CO2 capture and tar reduction.pdf,3,2,"For initial heating up of the system, air was supplied
through a 30- μm porous ceramic distributor plate of each reactor to
ﬂuidize the bed material. Moreover, the temperature and pressure of
all reactors were measured by K-type thermocouples and pressure trans-
ducers. It took around 3 –4 h to reach a bed temperature of 650 °C in the
gasiﬁer, of 900 °C in the regenerator and of 350 °C in the loopseal. Once
the bed attained these temperatures, the air ﬂow through the bed of
gasiﬁer was replaced with superheated steam supplied from the electric
steam generator and superheated by the electric steam superheater
installed below the gasi ﬁer. But the ﬂuidization in the regenerator and
in the loopseal was kept supplying with air but increased to highervelocities.
Table 3 shows the ﬂow rate and super ﬁcial velocity of different ﬂuid-
ization media supplied to each reactor based on theoretical calculation
and practical considerations for suitable ﬂuidizing regime. Unlike
other reactors, the aeration provided to the loopseal for all experimentswas suf ﬁcient to give a circulation of the solid from one to another reactor
as a looping process and this was also varied to allow different desiredsolid circulation rates. Once the system was stabilized at the desired tem-
perature in a circulating mode of the solid, the biomass feeding wasstarted from the hopper through a water cooled screw pipe. Thus,
biomass nearly at room temperature mechanically moved into the bed
at the desired constant feeding rate that was regulated by the variable
speed drive. Inside the system, unburned biomass char obtained from
gasiﬁcation leaves the gasi ﬁer together with the bed material through

Inside the riser-regenerator, the heat internally generated from char
combustion was transferred to the solid and also used to regenerate
calcium carbonate (CaCO
3) produced in and circulated from the gasi ﬁer.
The air supplied to the bed in the regenerator causes a fast ﬂuidization
so that the solid gets entrained and separated in the cyclone. Once sepa-
rated, the hot bed material falling through the standpipe will start ﬁlling
the gasi ﬁer and simultaneously providing heat to the gasiﬁ cation process.
Despite being heated by the circulating hot solid, the gasi ﬁcation process
was still being heated by electric heaters to maintain the bed temperatureconstant at 650 °C for all experiments. Once the gasi ﬁcation took place
steadily, that typically occurred 10 –15 min after feeding the biomass,
the hot syngas from the gasi ﬁerﬂowing through the sampling line, insu-
lated with ceramic insulation blanket, was condensed in cold traps wherethe condensed steam and tar as well as solid particles were collected in
ﬂasks. The dry and clean gas then passed through the sampling point

at some particular moments of the experiment. After the end of the ex-periment, the gas samples were analyzed in a gas chromatograph

taken for tar analysis. The liquid sampl e of tar, collected after each exper-
imental run, was paper- ﬁltered, homogenized and then used for quanti-
tative analysis of gravimetric tar. The concentration of gravimetric tar

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Hydrodynamics and pressure distribution
Fig. 2 shows the average pressure distribution in the present CLG
system to verify the circulating ﬂuidization regime in this CFB based
looping system. This is similar to what one would expect in a CFB system
[22,25] . The average voidage in the bubbling ﬂuidized-bed gasi ﬁer was
found to be 0.61. The average voidage in the turbulent bed section ofthe riser-regenerator was 0.82, which increases to 0.96 around its exit.
The pressure balance around the loop shows that the pressure inside
the gasi ﬁer is much higher than that at the top of the loopseal so that
no air going into the loopseal could ﬂow into the gasi ﬁer. This was also
veriﬁed by the negligible amount of air composition detected in the
product gas measured at the outlet of the gasi ﬁer. Moreover, the pressure
at the base of the loopseal is much higher than that in the regenerator so
that no gas can escape the regenerator through the loopseal.
Fig. 3 presents the average suspension density pro ﬁle in the riser-
regenerator calculated from the pressure measured along its height.
The nature of this suspension pro ﬁle is similar to the one observed in
CFB boilers [25]. These two characteristics of a nature of a CFB regime
found in this study can con ﬁrm that the system was operated in suitable
CFB-based looping process.Table 1

of the circulation rate on the quantity of CaO derived from regeneratingCaCO
3via a calcination reaction (Eq. (1)) in the regenerator and then
circulated to the gasi ﬁer, in which CO 2and tar are produced. This can
be also implied that a higher circulation rate allows a higher amount of
regenerated CaO in the gasi ﬁer. As a consequence, more sites are avail-
able for higher CO 2absorption by CaO via a carbonation reaction
(Eq.(2)). This conjecture was also reported by Udomsirichakorn et al.

simultaneously play another role in reforming tar into gas apart from
CO2absorption [9,17,26,27,29] . In-depth analysis of this is well discussed
elsewhere [17].
However for further increase of circulation rate beyond 1.04 kg/m2s, a
sudden decrease in H 2concentration to 73.08% with consistent increase
in CO 2concentration to 10.06% was noted ( Fig. 4 ). This could be attribut-
ed to a short residence time of CaCO 3in the regenerator along with low
calcination level of it, which consequently results in less amount of
reactivated CaO in the gasi ﬁer. This speculation is also supported by the
increase of tar content that is consistent with the decrease of total gasyield within the range of circulation rate of 1.04 –1.14 kg/m
2s(Fig. 5 ).
Overall, it can be concluded that even though a higher circulation
rate of bed material allows positive effect on production of H 2,C O 2

syngas and tar. However, due to unavailability of this information in
CaO-CLG system, more studies are encouraged to validate the present
results.
3.3. In ﬂuences of CaO-CLG on production of syngas and tar
The main focus of this experimental study is steam gasiﬁ cation of
biomass in the CaO-CLG system. To point out its superiority in terms
of gas and tar production, two baseline studies such as Sand-CLG as
well as CaO-BFBG were conducted for comparison. The experimental
results obtained for different gasi ﬁcation systems but at identical oper-
ating conditions (S/B = 3.41 and gasi ﬁcation temperature = 650 °C forall the systems, and solid circulation rate = 1.04 kg/m2s for both CLG
systems) are compared in Fig. 6 for gas composition and H 2yield
and in Fig. 7 for tar and total gas yields. It is evidenced that by using
CaO-CLG, one can produce the product gas with the highest concentra-tion and yield of H
2and the highest yield of total gas as well as lowest
contents of CO 2and tar.

Sand-CLG to 78% and reduce CO 2concentration from 21.16% obtained
for the same baseline system to almost zero ( Fig. 6 ). The plausible reason
of this CaO-based phenomenon could be explained by the correlation be-
tween the partial pressure reduction of CO 2due to carbonation reaction
(Eq. (2)) and the enhancement of water –gas shift reaction (Eq. (3)).
More details of this are previously described in Section 3.2 . In addition,
the signi ﬁcant decrease of tar content consistent with the increase of
total gas yield was also observed in CaO-CLG as compared to Sand-CLG
(Fig. 7 ). This ﬁnding can be explained with catalytic tar reforming reac-
tion of CaO (Eq. (4)). As observed in the present study, similar results
of the in ﬂu e n c eo fC a Oo nt h ep r o d u c t i o no fH 2,C O 2and tar were also re-
ported by many authors [9,29–31]but those results were obtained from
different gasi ﬁcation systems. Thus, to verify the superiority of CLG
system, the following discussion comparatively presents the resultsobtained for CaO-CLG and CaO-BFBG, both of which were identically
operated with CaO",319,"[ 0.00705802  0.00850629  0.02085019 ... -0.00096017  0.01670704

Compared to CaO-BFBG, the CaO-CLG system is better with higher
concentration and yields of H
2and lower contents of CO 2and tar
(Figs. 6 and 7 ). This may be because of more availability of CaO in the
gasiﬁer of CaO-CLG. In CaO-CLG, the gasi ﬁer is continuously ﬁlled with
regenerated CaO that is obtained from calcination of deactivated CaO
(i.e., CaCO 3) in the regenerator, unlike CaO-BFBG in which deactivated
CaO cannot be regenerated. This can contribute to the ﬁndings above.

Abstract: Iron-based oxygen carriers (OCs) have received much attention due to their low
costs, high mechanical strengths and high-temperature stabilities in the chemical looping
gasification (CLG) of biomass, but their chemical reactivity is very ordinary. Converter
steel slags (CSSs) are steelmaking wastes and rich in Fe 2O3, CaO and MgO, which have
good oxidative ability and good stability as well as catalytic effects on biomass gasification.
Therefore, the composite OCs prepared by mechanically mixing CSSs with iron-based OCs
are expected to be used to",268,"[ 0.04129003  0.0210708  -0.00638108 ...  0.01446532 -0.01328002

study, the catalytic performance of CSS/Fe 2O3composite OCs prepared by mechanically
mixing CSSs with iron-based OCs on the gasification of brewers’ spent grains (BSGs) were
investigated in a tubular furnace experimental apparatus. The results showed that when
the weight ratio of the CSSs in composite OCs was 0.5, the relative volume fraction of
hydrogen reached the maximum value of 49.1%, the product gas yield was 0.85 Nm3/kg
and the gasification efficiency was 64.05%. It could be found by X-ray diffraction patterns
and scanning electron microscope characterizations that the addition of CSSs helped to
form MgFe 2O4, which are efficient catalysts for H 2production. Owing to the large and
widely distributed surface pores of CSSs, mixing them with iron-based OCs was beneficial
for catalytic steam reforming to produce hydrogen.

1. Introduction
Brewers’ spent grains (BSGs) are the residues produced after the fermentation of barley
during the brewing process of beer. For each ton of beer, about 0.25 tons of BSGs will be
produced. In China, the annual output of beer was more than 35 million kiloliters in 2023. In
this situation, the annual production of BSGs has surpassed 10 million tons and continues to
rise. Untreated BSGs will rapidly deteriorate after 4–7 days and pollute the environment [ 1].
The accumulation of untreated BSGs poses various environmental risks, including hypoxia
and eutrophication of water bodies, as well as the salinization and acidification of soil [ 2].
BSGs were frequently utilized as animal feed due to their high content of crude protein
and micronutrients [ 3]. However, after being exposed to the air for a certain period, BSGs

may become rancid due to fermentation. Long term or excessive feeding of these BSGs can
cause poisoning in animals. When dried, BSGs possess a high heating value and can be
incinerated for thermal energy utilization [ 3]. Nevertheless, the high inherent moisture
content in BSGs presents challenges to their combustion, including elevated carbon content
in the residues, incomplete combustion, and potential NO xemissions due to their higher
nitrogen content [4].
Chemical looping gasification (CLG) is realized between an oxidation reactor and a
reduction reactor. This process uses highly active oxygen carrier particles for circulation to
play a role in carrying oxygen, carrying heat and catalyzing reactions [ 5]. In the reduction
reactor, nitrogen-free hydrogen-rich syngas is produced, while in the oxidation reactor,
the reduced oxygen carriers (OCs) are oxidized and regenerated. The CLG process also
can use calcium oxide as a carrier of carbon dioxide between two reactors. The capture
of the CO 2from the reduction reactor by the CaO particles can",245,"[ 0.02093492  0.034722    0.01873559 ... -0.00026267  0.0007208

forward water–gas shift reaction, thus resulting in a higher hydrogen yield in the product
gas [ 6]. The utilization of OCs can avoid the use of expensive pure oxygen for excluding
the production of nitrogen. Therefore, using CLG technology for the thermochemical
conversion of BSGs can achieve high-value utilization of BSGs while disposing of them. In
addition, many OCs have a catalytic effect on the thermal decomposition or reforming of
tars formed, resulting in the production of other small molecules and the tar reduction in
product gas [ 7]. In a word, the performances of carrier particles, involving redox, capturing
CO 2or catalysis, are critical for the production of high-quality syngas.
Currently, oxides of Fe, Ni, Cu, Mn or Co are common alternative oxygen-carrying
materials. Among these, iron-based OCs are particularly attractive due to their low cost,
high mechanical strength and thermal stability [ 8,9]. However, iron-based OCs exhib-
ited mediocre reactivity in the gasification reactions of different feedstocks, such as coal,
biomass [ 9,10",247,"[ 0.02753388  0.02781047  0.01354063 ...  0.01221423 -0.00145606

The reactivities of iron-based oxides are not excellent, which may hinder their application
and development [ 16,17]. To enhance the reactivities, different alkaline earth metals (e.g.,
Ca, Ba, or Mg) can be used to modify iron-based OCs. These modifications improve the
oxygen carriers’ reactivities and enhance the diffusivity of lattice oxygen [ 18–20]. Steel
slags (SSs) are solid wastes produced in the steelmaking and steel refining processes which
damage the environment when improperly managed. The SSs contain metallic elements
like Fe, Ca and Mg, and their main crystalline structures belong to perovskite and wüstite.
Some studies showed that using SSs as OCs in chemical looping gasification can ensure the
high reactivity of OCs [21,22].
Some scholars used iron-based OCs to produce syngas through chemical looping gasi-
fication of a certain type of biomass feedstock. For instance, Nguyen et al. [ 23] explored the
efficiency of syngas production in the chemical looping gasification of torr",263,"[ 0.0186363   0.02379206  0.02379206 ...  0.01644236 -0.01725899

within a pilot-scale bubbling fluidized bed system, utilizing iron ore as an OC. Their find-
ings indicated that the carbon conversion efficiency for iron ore peaked at 91.42% when the
oxygen-carrier-to-biomass ratio (OBR) was set at 6, while the content of H 2reached a peak
of 42.89% for iron ore at a steam-to-biomass mass ratio (SBR) of 1.4. Their study showed
that the increase in the OBR value caused a reduction in H 2production, a downward trend
in syngas yield and an upward trend in carbon conversion efficiency. For H 2production in
the CLG process, the SBR value is crucial. Nguyen’s study also stated that the content of
H2increased with the steam amount used; higher SBR values also enhanced the syngas
yield as well as the product gas yield and process efficiencies, but excess steam may cause
a decline in the CLG performance due to heat loss in the gasifier. Huang et al. [ 24] used
iron-based OCs to produce syngas through the chemical looping gasification of rice husks
and analyzed the effects of the ratio of oxygen carriers to rice husks (O/C), temperatu",279,"[ 0.01778734 -0.00085722  0.01306002 ... -0.02228775 -0.01347602

residence time and preparation methods of iron-based OCs. Their findings indicated that
as the O/C ratio rose from 0.5 to 3.0, there was a gradual increase in gas production, the
H2/CO ratio, CO 2yield and carbon conversion efficiency. Conversely, the yields of H 2, CO
and CH 4, as well as the lower heating value (LHV), experienced a gradual decline.
Some studies have also explored the synergistic effects of two different feedstocks in
chemical looping co-gasification (CLCG). Luo et al. [ 25] conducted a CLCG of rice husks
with coal in a fixed-bed reactor using iron ore as an oxygen carrier and investigated the
influence of parameters such as the ratio of oxygen carriers to rice husks (O/C), reaction
temperature, reaction residence time and rice husk blending ratio on the gasification perfor-
mance. The findings indicated that the CLCG process delivered the optimal performance
at an oxygen/carbon ratio of 0.2, a furnace temperature of 900◦C and a steam flow rate of
0.125 g/min. When the blending ratio of rice husks was 50%, the synergistic effect reac",277,"[ 0.0037166  -0.00510643  0.01963866 ... -0.00710215 -0.01422928

the highest value. In another study, Liu et al. [ 26] carried out a CLCG of pine wood and
polyethylene using CaO/Fe 2O3oxygen carriers in a fixed-bed reactor and thermogravimet-
ric analyzer (TGA) and investigated the effects of the mass ratio of Fe 2O3to biomass and
temperature, and the mass ratio of steam to biomass, on the syngas yield, H 2/CO ratio and
cold gas efficiency. It was found that the optimal product distribution was obtained at a
gasification temperature of 850◦C, a mass ratio of Fe 2O3to biomass of 0.25, and a mass
ratio of steam to biomass of 0.25. The addition of polyethylene increased the syngas and
hydrogen yield, and the optimal addition ratio of polyethylene was 75%.
Beyond the feedstocks, attention has been focused on the choice of OCs. Sun et al. [ 27]
proposed chemical looping deoxygenation gasification (CLDG) for the preparation of high-
quality syngas with an adjustable H 2/CO ratio and the use of CO 2. In their study, a ther-
modynamic simulation was conducted to verify the feasibility of CLDG using Aspen Plus.

reactor. Through two deoxygenation reactions ( 2CaO + 2Fe + 3H 2O = Ca 2Fe2O5+ 3H 2and
2CaO + 2Fe + 3CO 2= Ca 2Fe2O5+ 3CO), Ca 2Fe2O5was synthesized. The desired H 2/CO
ratio in the syngas could be obtained by regulating the H 2O and CO 2flow rates, while
tar cracking was achieved through CaO as catalysis. Wei et al. [ 28] investigated the CLG
of biomass in a fluidized bed reactor using Fe–Ni bimetallic oxides as OCs. Their experi-
mental results indicated that the concentrations of CO, H 2and CH 4in the syngas, along
with the carbon conversion rate and gasification efficiency, increased with rising reaction
temperatures, while CO 2fractions decreased due to exothermic processes. However, it
was observed that as the biomass-to-oxygen-carrier ratio increased, the carbon conversion
efficiency declined. This could be due to the limited availability of reactive sites on the
oxygen carrier at higher biomass loadings.

furnace slags (BOFSs) and electric arc furnace slags (EAFSs) as OCs for the CLG of sewage
sludge. Their findings revealed that the surface roughness and wear resistance of BOFSs
were higher than those of EAFSs. Additionally, at both 800◦C and 900◦C under identical
redox cycles, the oxygen transport capacity of BOFSs exceeded that of EAFSs, resulting
in a significantly higher content of combustible components in each cycle. These findings
offer a theoretical foundation for using steel slags as OCs in the CLG of solid wastes.
Niu et al. [ 15] used several Ca- and Mg-rich steelmaking wastes from the steelmaking
industry as OCs in the CLG of biomass. Their study indicated that the reducibility of
Linz–Donawitz converter slags (LD slags) and blast furnace dust (BF dust) was superior to
that of hematite, and LD slags presented excellent stability during multiple redox cycles,
while BF dust showed poor stability. Furthermore, Ca- and Mg-rich waste exhibited a
higher syngas production, which could be attributed to the improved reduction rate of",269,[0.02445451 0.0175942  0.01522049 ... 0.01199901 0.01295111 0.0065049 ]

used phosphogypsum (PG) and steel slags (SSs) to prepare OCs for hydrogen-enriched
syngas production through CLG technology. In their study, the reaction mechanism and
the impact of operating parameters were analyzed using FactSage 7.1 simulations and then
validated through fixed-bed tests. The outcomes demonstrated that the SSs notably boosted
the effectiveness of the developed OCs.
In this study, iron-based OCs were first prepared by the co-precipitation method and
put into a tubular furnace for the gasification of BSGs. The effects of operation parameters

by the product gas yield and gasification efficiency. Subsequently, CSS/Fe 2O3composite
OCs were prepared by mechanically mixing converter steel slags with iron-based OCs. The
effects of the weight ratio of CSSs in CSS/Fe 2O3composite OCs on the CLG process of
BSGs were investigated, and then the optimal weight ratio of CSSs in the composite OCs
was determined. Finally, the CSS/Fe 2O3composite OCs were analyzed by X-ray diffraction
patterns and characterized by scanning electron microscope images in order to explore
their function mechanism on the CLG process.

The two main purposes of using catalysts in the gasification of BSGs are the removal of
tar from the product gas and reduction of the methane content in the product gas. Catalytic
gasification was developed in response to the need for tar reforming in which both alkaline
earth metal catalysts and iron-based catalysts are effective [ 32]. As the product gas passes
through the catalyst particles, the tar or condensable hydrocarbons can be reformed with
steam or carbon dioxide at the catalyst surface to produce additional hydrogen and carbon
monoxide. In this way, the catalytic tar reforming reaction yields extra fuel gas, replacin",197,"[ 0.02575781  0.00070412 -0.00282424 ...  0.003837   -0.00092978

Catalytic steam reforming or catalytic carbon dioxide reforming of lower-molecular-
weight hydrocarbons in the presence of iron-based catalysts can be utilized to remove
lower-molecular-weight hydrocarbons such as methane from the product gas [ 37]. This
type of reforming is crucial for syngas production, especially when methane is undesirable
and a precise ratio of CO and H 2in the product gas is required. In the presence of the
catalysts, methane is converted to CO and H 2by reacting with steam at a high temperature
(typically 750–950◦C) [38] or is reformed by carbon dioxide at a temperature range of 700

were carried out at five different gasifier temperatures in the range of 750◦C–950◦C to
investigate the effects of the gasifier temperature on the CLG of BSGs. The mass ratio
of the OCs to BSGs was set as 1.0, and the flow rate of water vapor was maintained at
0.125 g/min.
The relative volume fractions Riof the four main gas components in the product gas
at different temperatures are shown in Figure 3. As the gasifier temperature increased, the
relative volume fractions of CO and CO 2exhibited an overall increasing trend, increasing,
respectively, by 9.08% and 2.46%, while the relative volume fractions of H 2and CH 4
declined by 3.96% and 9.19%, respectively. In this temperature interval, the reactivity of
Fe2O3is enhanced at elevated temperatures, promoting oxidation reactions of unburned
combustible gases and reducing the relative volume fractions of H 2and CH 4. In addition,

Reactions (R4)–(R10)), the producer gas reaction (Reaction (R11)) and the Boudouard
reaction (Reaction (R13)) are all heat absorbing. Higher temperatures promote these
heat-absorbing reactions, leading to an increase in the CO and CO 2content. While the
intensification of the partial oxidation (Reactions (R5)–(R9)) also raised the H 2content, the
intensification of the H 2oxidation (Reaction (R3)) accelerated the thermal conversion of
H2, resulting in an overall decrease in its relative volume fraction as the temperature rises.
Therefore, the relative volume fractions of CO 2and CO showed an increasing trend. When
the gasifier temperature exceeded 900◦C, the relative volume fractions of CO and CO 2did
not change significantly, likely due to the propensity of brewers’ spent grains to undergo
coking at excessively high temperatures, which reduces gas production [40].

crease at higher temperatures, the QLvalue decreased from 10,729.65 kJ/kg to 8069.22 kJ/kg
when the gasifier temperature was increased from 750◦C to 950◦C. This indicates that
higher temperatures lead to a reduction in the calorific value of the product gas, which is
detrimental for obtaining gaseous products with a higher calorific value.
The impact of the gasification temperature on the gas yield and gasification efficiency
is depicted in Figure 4. It is evident that both gas yield and gasification efficiency generally
increase with a rising temperature. This suggests that high temperatures promote pyrolysis
of solid products, gasification of carbon and reactions between the BSGs and OCs, leading
to an increase in the relative volume fractions of gaseous products. When the temperature

of H 2in the product gas. Meanwhile, the transformation of CO to CO 2was expedited by
the intensified water–gas shift reaction (Reaction (R8)) due to the increased steam flow.
Thus, higher steam flow rates yielded greater amounts of CO 2and H 2.

by 0.48 Nm3/kg and 21.23%, respectively. This indicated that the BSG gasification reaction
was more effective at higher steam flow rates, leading to a greater conversion of BSGs into
gaseous products and an increase in H 2production. However, it is important to note that
the steam flow rate cannot be elevated indefinitely, as steam generation requires energy.
Considering energy consumption and utilization efficiency, a suitable steam flow rate of
0.125 g/min was ultimately selected for this study.

to the adequate supply of lattice oxygen within this weight ratio range, where increasing

From the XRD pattern and SEM image of the CSS/Fe 2O3composite OCs after use
in chemical looping gasification, it can be observed that the interactions between MgO in
CSSs and Fe 2O3in iron-based OCs resulted in the formation of spinel ferrite MgFe 2O4,
which is an efficient catalyst for H 2production via steam reforming of pyrolysis volatiles.
The CSS/Fe 2O3composite OCs demonstrated a higher chemical reactivity compared
to the iron-based OCs, which was attributed to the interaction between the alkaline earth
metal oxides in CSSs and iron-based OCs. As the cycle number increased, the oxygen
release capacity of the CSS/Fe 2O3composite OCs weakened, but after the 8th cycle, the Ri
value of H 2tended to be relatively stable",191,"[ 0.0300799  -0.00495218  0.00031876 ...  0.00097328 -0.02622229

Tars in biomass gasiﬁcation systems need to be removed to avoid damaging and clogging downstream
pipes or equipment. In this study, Ni-based catalysts were made by mechanically mixing NiO and char
particles at various ratios. Catalytic performance of the Ni/char catalysts was studied and compared with
performance of wood char and coal char without Ni for syngas cleanup in a laboratory-scale updraft bio-mass gasiﬁer. Reforming parameters investigated were reaction temperature (650–850 /C176C), NiO loading
(5–20% of the weight of char support), and gas residence time (0.1–1.2 s). The Ni/coalchar and Ni/wood-
char catalysts removed more than 97% of tars in syngas at 800 /C176C reforming temperature, 15% NiO load-

CO in syngas signiﬁcantly. Furthermore, performance of the Ni/coalchar catalyst was continuously tested
for 8 h. There was slight deactivation of the catalyst in the early stage of tar/syngas reforming; however,the catalyst was able to stabilize soon after. It was concluded that chars especially coal char can be aneffective and inexpensive support of NiO for biomass gasiﬁcation tar removal and syngas conditioning.

1. Introduction
Biomass gasiﬁcation is considered one of the most promising
technologies for production of sustainable fuels [1–4] . Biomass
gasiﬁcation is a process in which biomass undergoes incomplete
combustion to produce a gas product called syngas that consists
mainly of H 2, CO, CH 4,C O 2, and N 2(if air is used in combustion)
in various proportions. Biomass gasiﬁcation has many advantages
over direct combustion. It converts low-value feedstocks to high-
quality combustible gases, which can be not only directly burned
or used for electricity generation but also turned into liquid trans-portation fuels [5]. However, tars are produced along with syngas
during biomass gasiﬁcation and their contents vary from about
0.5–100 g/m
3depending on the type and design of the gasiﬁer,
feedstock used, and operating condition",320,"[ 0.03555709 -0.00855446  0.03421784 ...  0.02033428 -0.00339835

E:\\PINNs-Research\\Searched Articles\\Char and char-supported nickel catalysts for secondary syngas cleanup.pdf,1,3,"s [6]. Tar is a generic term
comprising all organic compounds present in syngas except gas-
eous hydrocarbons. Tars can condense to more complex structures
in pipes, ﬁlters, or heat exchangers of downstream equipment and
processes, which may cause mechanical breakdown of the entire
system. Tars may also deactivate catalysts in the reﬁning process.
It is essential to reduce the level of tars to enable widespread uti-
lization of syngas. Several approaches for tar removal, such as
physical treatment [7,8] , thermal cracking [9], plasma-assisted
cracking [10], and catalytic reforming [11,12] , have been reportedin the literatures. Among these, catalytic reforming is considered
the most promising in large-scale applications because of its fast
reaction rate and reliability [13] and its ability to increase the
quantity of useable gases such as CO and H 2in syngas.
Various types of catalysts such as calcined rocks [14], zeolites
[15], iron ores [16], alkali metals [17], Ni-based catalysts [18], and
precious metals [19] have been studied for their usefulness in tar
removal in biomass gasiﬁcation. For catalytic reactivity and
economic reasons, Ni-based catalysts are considered the most
promising for tar removal and syngas reforming [20–23] . Nickel
catalysts are usually supported by metal oxides (e.g., Al 2O3and
MgO",338,"[-0.00639318  0.01248316  0.02414055 ...  0.02414055  0.00242728

charcoal) [24–29] . These supports are relatively expensive, and
the catalyst preparation steps involving impregnation and calcina-
tion are time and energy consuming; these factors limit extensive
application of Ni-based catalysts. As a promising alternative, chars
have been reported to be an inexpensive catalyst with fair perfor-
mance in tar removal [30–33] and also an excellent adsorbent
[34]. This pioneering research investigated catalytic performance
of a new catalyst called Ni/char, which was made by mechanically
mixing char particles and NiO powders. This catalyst is unique in
that char serves as an inexpensive support and also a catalyst and
that no impregnation or calcination steps are needed in catalyst
preparation.
The objectives of this study were (1) to examine the feasibility
of using chars as the Ni catalyst support while the chars also
serve as a catalyst themselves and (2) to determine the effect of

mixing Ni particles with wood char and coal char particles sepa-
rately. The char-supported Ni catalysts were tested in a labora-
tory-scale updraft biomass gasiﬁer. Chars without Ni were also
studied as the baseline for comparison.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Catalyst preparation and characterization
Four types of catalysts were prepared and studied: wood char,
coal char, wood char with NiO (Ni/woodchar), and coal char with
NiO (Ni/coalchar). The wood char and coal char were obtained
from Royal Oak Enterprises, Inc. (Omaha, AR). Chars were crushed
and sieved to obtain particles in the size range of 40–60 meshes
(0.3–0.45 mm). The porous char support provides an excellent
medium for adhesion of the micro-NiO particles. Nickel oxide pow-
ders (AC41558, density 6.67 g/ml) were purchased from Fisher Sci-
entiﬁc (Pittsburgh, PA). The Ni/woodchar and Ni/coalchar catalysts
were prepared by mechanically mixing char particles and NiO par-
ticles in a transparent glass beaker at desired ratios of Ni",306,"[ 0.01776797 -0.01671681  0.0103816  ... -0.0067082   0.00525579

All Ni catalysts were scanned with a HITACHI S-3500 N scan-
ning electron microscope (SEM; Hitachi, Ibaraki, Japan) and an
EDX (energy dispersive X-ray) measurement was conducted. For
more detained characterization of the catalysts, hydrogen chemi-
sorption was performed to determine Ni dispersion rate and spe-
ciﬁc surface area and diameter of sphere crystallites using a
Zeton Altamira AMI-200 unit (Altamira Instruments, Pittsburgh,
PA). Hydrogen chemisorption method was previously used to
investigate Ni distribution on activated carbons by some otherresearchers [35,36] . This method was adopted in this study consid-
ering the similarity between activated carbon and chars. The cata-
lyst (0.1 g) was loaded in a U-shaped quartz reactor ﬁtted with a
thermocouple for continuous temperature measurements. Thermal
treatment of samples was conducted with 10% H

2.2. Apparatus and experimental parameters
The experimental system was composed of three subsystems:
(1) biomass gasiﬁer system, which provided a constant ﬂow of
raw syngas at a speciﬁc ﬂow rate to the reforming unit via control
of a ﬂow control valve and vacuum pump; (2) tar reforming unit;
and (3) tar collection unit. A schematic diagram of the system is
shown in Fig. 1 , and details of each subsystem are presented in
the following sections.
2.2.1. Biomass gasiﬁer system
Gasiﬁcation of sawdust was carried out in a laboratory-scale
updraft biomass gasiﬁer system, which consists of a reaction
chamber, gas cooler, and blower assembly. The gasiﬁer has an
overall syngas production rate of 5–50 ft.3/min depending on the
voltage to the 15-W blower, which is used to blow air from the bot-
tom of the gasiﬁer into the reaction chamber. The raw syngas pro-
duced ﬂows into the gas cooler, in which steam and a fraction of
tars condense and are collected. In gasiﬁcation tar reforming
experiments, a small fraction of the syngas from the outlet on
the top of the gas cooler was directed to the",338,"[-0.00272761  0.01997033  0.02050393 ... -0.02111701  0.0128178

equipped with a single set-point temperature controller for up to a
maximum working temperature of 1200 /C176C. The catalyst bed was
placed in the center of the tube and horizontally supported by
two alumina foam blocks (MTI Corporation, Richmond, CA). In a
typical experiment, syngas ﬂowed into the tube at one end, passed
through the catalyst bed, and left at the other end. Residual tar was
collected by the tar collection unit.
Table 2 shows the experimental parameters of tar reforming.
Temperatures were in the range of 650–850 /C176C at steps of 50 /C176C,
and NiO loadings ranged from 0% to 20% at steps of 5%. Gas resi-
dence times were set at 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9 and 1.2 s by adjusting
the syngas ﬂow rate in the reforming tube through the ﬂow control
valve.
2.2.3. Sampling and analysis
The cold trapping method [12] was used for tar collection. The
tar sampling system was composed of four 250-ml ﬂasks dipped
into an insulation box ﬁlled with dry ice as shown in Fig. 1 . Each
sampling ran for at least 15 min to ensure that more than 100 l
of syngas ﬂowed through the cold ﬂasks. All tars and water vapor
were collected in the ﬂasks, which were then dried at 105 /C176Ci n
an oven for 2 h. The residue was considered as tars. Other research-
ers have used similar or slightly modiﬁed forms of this method
[37,38] . It must be noted that only heavy tars (boiling point above
105 /C176C) were measured in this study considering that heavy tars
(e.g., heterocyclic compounds, heavy poly-aromatics and asphalt)
are more damaging and difﬁcult to remove than lights tars in cat-
alytic cracking.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of Ni catalysts
As shown in Fig. 2 , Ni was distributed more uniformly on the
surface of the coal char support ( Fig. 2 b) than on the wood char
support ( Fig. 2 a). This is mainly a result of the porous surface struc-
ture of the coal char ( Fig. 2 d), which enhanced adhesion of NiO par-
ticles. The wood char used in this study had relatively smooth and
less porous surfaces that did not allow easy deposition of Ni
particles.
The elemental compositions of wood char and coal char used in
the experiments were analyzed by SEM/EDX. Compared with wood
char, coal char contained more O, Na, K, Ca, and Si ( Table 3 ), which
are helpful in tar removal [32].The observation of Ni distributions on chars via SEM/EDX was
conﬁrmed by the H 2chemisorption study. As shown in Table 4 ,
the Ni dispersion rate on the coal char was almost twice as that
of on the wood char, and the speciﬁc surface area of Ni on the coal
char was also signiﬁcantly bigger than on the wood char, which
indicate that the coal char is much better than the wood char as
a support for the NiO particles used in this study. In H 2chemisorp-
tion analysis, in addition to the chemical adsorption between H 2
and nickel, physical adsorption of H 2also occurred on char surfaces
when char was used as the catalyst support. However, H 2adsorbed
by char was removed by argon scavenging in the process of cata-
lyst characterization. Therefor",450,"[ 0.02483569 -0.05595168 -0.00781468 ... -0.01190044 -0.00386868

not include and were not affected by the surface area of chars.
It must be noted that physical and chemical properties (e.g.,
porosity and metallic contents) of chars are highly dependent ontheir origins and production methods [30,39,40] . Consequently,
Ni distributions on char support and their tar removal performance
are expected to vary with different types of chars. Therefore, obser-
vations and analyses above are valid only for the char samples
chosen in this study and cannot be generalized to conclude that
coal char as a catalyst support is better than wood char, or vice
versa.
3.2. Catalytic performance of Ni/char catalysts3.2.1. Effect of reforming temperature
The effect of reforming temperature in the range from 650 /C176Ct o
850 /C176C on tar removal and syngas composition was investigated
while NiO loading and gas residence time were ﬁxed at 15 wt.%
and 0.3 s, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3 , tar removal rate in-
creased with increasing reaction temperature in all cases. Under
the same reaction conditions, the Ni/coalchar catalyst showed
the highest tar removal rate (ranging from 91% to 99%). Ni/wood-
char achieved a slightly lower tar removal rate (86–96%). Without
Ni, coal char and wood char could also remove 75–90% tars
depending on the temperature. This indicates that char alone is a
reasonably effective catalyst for tar removal. Abu El-Rub et al.
[30] reported that biomass char decomposed 81% of phenol at
700 /C176C and more than 94% of naphthalene at 900 /C176C in a simulated
experiment. In another study, Abu El-Rub [32] reported that bio-
mass char removed more than 85% of naphthalene but only 58%
of real tars at 750 /C176C.",429,"[ 0.02486366 -0.03655496  0.02959852 ... -0.00481341  0.01104615

E:\\PINNs-Research\\Searched Articles\\Char and char-supported nickel catalysts for secondary syngas cleanup.pdf,3,4,"Gilbert et al. [33] found that the presence
of char was helpful, but not to a sufﬁciently high degree, in pro-
moting heavy tar cracking in a ﬁxed-bed gasiﬁer. Real tars contain
heavier and more complicated tars, such as asphaltum, than a
model tar. This indicates that char alone is an effective catalyst
for light tar removal but lacks sufﬁcient reactivity for heavy tars.
Therefore, a Ni catalyst supported by coal char, such as that ex-plored in this study, is a good catalyst design to take advantage
of the high reactivity of Ni for heavy tar and effectiveness of char
for light tar cracking in syngas cleaning.
Fig. 4 shows concentrations of combustible gases as a function
of reaction temperature for the four catalysts. Wood char and coal
char slightly enhanced H
2and CO production compared with no
catalyst at all temperatures. Ni/coalchar and Ni/woodchar showed
more increases in H 2and CO, indicating that Ni is more effective
than char only in reforming tars to generate CO and H 2.
The following reactions based on the tar thermal cracking and
reforming mechanisms proposed by Baker and Mudge [41,42] , con-
vert tars and light hydrocarbons into H 2and CO with the presence
of NiO catalysts.

In addition to the above mechanisms that are common for Ni
catalysts, reactions (6) and (7) below may also take place with
the presence of char as the catalyst support. Abu El-Rub [32] be-
lieved that tars can be adsorbed on the active sites of char particles.
The adsorbed tars and cokes formed can be catalytically reformed
to CO and H 2by steam and dry gasiﬁcation reactions, and mean-
while, free radicals that enter polymerization reactions and coke
on char surfaces can be formed from tar decomposition. The gasi-
ﬁcation reactions of coke cannot only increase CO and H 2in syngas,
but also refresh the",195,"[ 0.01265414 -0.02379661 -0.01884711 ... -0.010027   -0.00365727

above 800 /C176C may not be worthwhile considering that overheating
usually causes sintering of the catalyst and consumes more energy
[43]. For this reason, 800 /C176C was considered an appropriate tem-
perature for tar removal in this study.

Fig. 5 , tar removal rate steadily increased with increasing NiO load-
ing, indicating that Ni plays a signiﬁcant role in tar removal. The
Ni/coalchar catalyst showed better performance than the Ni/wood-
char catalyst at all NiO loadings because of the better dispersion of
Ni on coal char particles as described in Section 3.1. A rapid in-
crease of tar removal was observed from 10% to 20% NiO loading
on wood char, indicating that wood char needs higher loadings
of Ni because of poor adhesion of Ni particles on the char surface.
This suggests that better mixing of Ni and wood char particles is
required. Also, some means to improve adhesion capability and
porosity of wood char is needed.
The effect of NiO loading on syngas composition is shown Fig. 6 .
With the increase of Ni content from 0% to 20%, H 2concentration
signiﬁcantly increased from 27.33 to 32.53 vol.% for Ni/woodchar
and from 28.57 to 34.33 vol.% for Ni/coalchar, which again suggests
that it is mainly Ni that enhanced H 2generation. CO concentration

15% NiO loading for both catalysts. When N",305,"[ 0.02499041 -0.02339675 -0.00875935 ...  0.00129918  0.01172147

creased from 15% to 20%, CO concentration dropped slightly. These
indicate that there is a competition between Ni and char in tar
cracking. When Ni is dominant (e.g., at higher NiO loadings or bet-
ter distribution of Ni on the support surface), more H 2is generated.
On the other hand, more CO is produced if syngas is more exposed
to chars than to Ni. Other researchers have observed a similar phe-
nomenon. Bangala et al. [21] reported that syngas yield increased
with the loading percentage of Ni on alumina until 15% anddecreased above this percentage. Furusawa and Tsutsumi [19] also
reported that when Ni loading on MgO increased from 12% to 36%,
the H 2and CO contents in syngas decreased from 77.2 to 75.9 vol.%
and from 2.9 to 2.5 vol.%, respectively. Zhao et al. [20] found that
adding more Ni particles did not signiﬁcantly increase available
Ni surface area. Bartholomew and Farrauto [44] explained that
nickel dispersion decreased with increasing nickel loading. There-
fore, it is not surprising that too much Ni on char deteriorates
the performance of the catalyst; 15% could be an optimum NiO
loading for the char supports used in this study.

Fig. 7 shows tar removal rate as a function of gas residence time.
Tar removal rate remained high when gas residence time was
greater than 0.3 s but decreased signiﬁcantly below that point. This
result indicates that tars need sufﬁcient time ( P0.3 s) to decom-
pose, even in the presence of the Ni/coalchar catalyst. When gas
residence time increased beyond 0.3 s, the increase of tar removal
rate slowed gradually. Longer gas residence times require use of
more catalysts or lower syngas ﬂow rates, so a minimal but reason-
ably effective time is desired. Therefore, 0.3 s was chosen as an
appropriate gas residence time to test catalyst performance in
other experiments. It is also evident that Ni/coalchar had the best
tar removal performance among all catalysts at all gas residence
times tested.
Fig. 8 shows the change of H 2and CO concentrations at various
gas residence times. H 2concentration increased sharply when gas
residence time increased from 0.1 s to 0.3 s. After 0.3 s, the increase
of H 2concentration slowed, similar to the trend of tar removal rate.

found that 0.2 s gas residence time was enough to convert more
than 90% of phenol at 750 /C176C. Using a commercial Ni catalyst at
750 /C176C, Kinoshita et al. [22] found that syngas compositions re-
mained stable after 1.3 s gas residence time. Because tar removal
is the main purpose of catalytic reforming, and longer gas resi-
dence times require slower syngas ﬂow rates or the use of more
catalysts, a minimal but reasonably effective time, such as 0.3 s,
is desired.

Stability and durability of a catalyst are as important as its reac-
tivity and selectivity. For this reason, the Ni/coalchar catalyst was

rate (>97%) in the ﬁrst 2 h, and then the rate slightly decreased
but remained stable and high after 2 h. CO and H 2concentrations
showed similar trends of a small reduction after 2 h and then sta-
bilized. These phenomena indicate that slight deactivation of the

is not clear. It may be a result of uncollected catalyst residue on
the reforming tube after the experiment, or because of the escape
of volatile compounds in chars while heated, or due to the carry-
away loss of char particles by syngas ﬂow. It can also be possible
that chars were gasiﬁed when they are exposed to steam and
CO2in syngas to generate H 2and CO as explained in Section

There are several advantages to using chars as the catalyst support.
First, chars are less expensive than metal oxides. Second, Ni can be
saved by using char as the support. Ni particles stay only on the
outer surface of the char support. In metal-oxide-supported cata-
lysts, however, Ni is also formed inside the support via the impreg-
nating and calcining methods. The outer surfaces of catalysts are
active sites, but the inside of the support is usually not; thus, a

Biochar chemical looping gasi ﬁcation (CLG) is a novel technology to obtain hydrogen-rich syngas, high

1. Introduction
As an energy of environmentally friendly and high energy
density, hydrogen is considered to be an alternative to fossil fuel intheﬁelds of heating, electricity and transportation [ 1,2]. With the
development and application of industrial production and
hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in recent years, more and more re-
searchers in industry and scienti ﬁc institutions pay attention to
hydrogen production [ 3,4]. However, most of hydrogen is currently
supplied with by-products in the conversion process of fossil fuel
[5]. Moreover, hydrogen production by water electrolysis will
consume excessive energ",289,"[ 0.02385175  0.00924193  0.06044758 ... -0.0208021  -0.01033907

ciently produce hydrogen from renewable energy [ 7].
Biochar is the by-product of biomass pyrolysis for bio-oil, which
is renewable, environmentally friendly and low cost [ 8]. After py-
rolysis, biochar is rich in pore structure with less impurities [ 9].
Meanwhile, it will not exist the tar problems during the thermalconversion process of biochar [ 10]. Biochar is an excellent raw
material in gasi ﬁcation, which can be converted into syngas
through gasi ﬁcation or reforming technology [ 11]. Therefore, bio-
char has the potential to produce hydrogen-rich syngas in arenewable way.
Chemical looping gasi ﬁcation (CLG) is a novel and ef ﬁcient
technology for hydrogen production. The oxygen is absorbed by
oxygen carrier in the air reactor to form the lattice oxygen, gener-
ating the oxidized oxygen carrier [ 12]. The lattice oxygen of oxygen
carrier is provided to fuel after transporting into the fuel reactor,
producing syngas [ 13]. After losing lattice oxygen, the reduced
oxygen carrier is produced and then returned to the air reactor for
the next cycle. The ratio of H
2and CO (H 2/CO) can be controlled
quantitatively by ad",293,"[ 0.00503718 -0.00273652  0.00129586 ... -0.01170661 -0.01169491

gen carrier [ 14]. Thus, the syngas produced by CLG will obtain a
wide range of applications [ 15]. In addition, oxygen carrier also
provides catalysis to promote the reaction during CLG [ 16]. There-
fore, more and more researchers focus on the study of chemical
looping process to produce syngas or hydrogen-rich syngas
[17e19].
Owing to the advantages of low cost, environmental friendli-
ness, high carbon conversion, good mechanical strength and reac-
tion performance, Fe-based oxygen carrier has become an
important oxygen carrier in CLG [ 20,21]. Hematite is used as oxygen*Corresponding author.

lignite conversion to syngas after CLG without serious sintering
[22]. The CLG of microalgae is conducted by using single Fe 2O3
oxygen carrier, revealing that oxygen carrier content and temper-
ature will affect the syngas production and ef ﬁciency, meanwhile
Fe2O3will sinter at high temperature [ 23]. Fe 2O3/Al2O3prepared by
impregnation method is used as oxygen carrier in a continuous
biomass CLG, which obtaines a syngas of 37% H 2, 21% CO, 34% CO 2
and 7% CH 4, and a high reactivity with some Fe lost [ 24]. However,
high concentration of CO 2is indispensable. Ca can promote the tar
cracking and absorb CO 2through carbonation, improving the H 2
concentration [ 25]. Thus, Ca is added into Fe-based oxygen carrier
to improve CLG performance by many researchers. A visible
improvement of syngas production is recorded in CLG process after
CaO mixed mechanically with Fe 2O3[15]. Fe 2O3/CaO prepared by
impregnation method is used as oxygen carrier in biomass CLG, the
results indicates that this oxygen carrier has a great hydrogen
selectivity but should be enhanced the cyclic durability [ 26].
Based on the previous studies, oxygen carrier prepared by
different methods may affect the reaction performance and the
interaction of oxygen carrier [ 27]. Most studies have focused on the
reaction performance based on oxygen carrier prepared by single
method, which cannot analyze the interaction between the carr",379,"[ 4.2841919e-02 -3.9530667e-05  5.4216094e-02 ...  1.0326875e-02

and the active component. Moreover, preparation method of oxy-
gen carrier is a key factor worthy of further study. However, no
study has investigated the comprehensive consideration of reaction
performance under different preparation methods. Therefore,
concerns of the above insuf ﬁciency, the objective of this study is to
evaluate the oxygen carrier performance on biochar CLG under
different preparation methods of oxygen carrier. To gain better
insight into the performance of Fe/Ca based oxygen carrier, the
effects of Fe loadings, active components, Ca loadings and steam/
biochar (S/C) are studied on hydrogen-rich syngas production, CLG
performance and oxygen carrier characterization. The results will
be helpful for the hydrogen-rich syngas production and prepara-
tion methods of oxygen carrier on biochar CLG process.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
Biochar is used as the CLG feedstock, which is produced from the
pyrolysis of camellia shell under 550/C14C for 10 min. Before pyrolysis,
camellia shell is grinded to obtain particles less than 20 mm. The
proximate analysis, ultimate analysis and lower heating value
(LHV) of biochar and camellia shell are shown in Table 1 .A f t e r
grinding and sieving, the particle size of biochar is less than
200mm.
Four preparation methods for oxygen carrier are conducted in
this study.1) Single Fe 2O3method: the analytical purity Fe 2O3is calcined at
900/C14C for 4 h, and then is grinded to attain the oxygen carrier

2) Fe 2O3/Al2O3mechanical blending method: the analytical purity
Fe2O3and Al 2O3with a molar ratio of Fe:Al ¼1:2 are mechan-
ically blended. They are calcined at 900/C14C for 4 h, and then
grinded to attain the oxygen carrier with a particle size less than200
mm.
3) Impregnation method: based on the molar ratio of Fe:Al ¼1:2,
Al2O3, Fe(NO 3)3/C159H2O and 100 mL deionized water are placed in
a beaker and stirred at 65/C14C for 2 h. After dried at 105/C14C for 12 h,
the sample is calcined at 400/C14C for 2 h and 900/C14C for 4 h. And
then the sample is grinded to attain the oxygen carrier with a
particle size less than 200 mm.
4) Coprecipitation method: under different molar ratios of active
components (Fe, Cu, Mn, Ca):Ca:Al, nitrate solutions of active
components, Ca(NO 3)2/C154H2O, Al(NO 3)3/C159H2O and 100 mL
deionized water are dissolved in a beaker. During stirring at
25/C14C, 1 mol/L ammonium carbonate solution is added slowly
into the mixture until the solution changes into a colloidal
suspension. After dried at a vacuum drying oven at 105/C14C for
12 h, the sample is calcined at 400/C14C for 2 h and 900/C14C for 4 h.
And then the sample is grinded to attain the oxygen carrier with
a particle size less than 200 mm.
According to our previous studies [ 14,28], 1.5 is the optimal ratio
of active component/feedstock to obtain high ef ﬁciencies and
syngas production. Therefore, a certain amount of oxygen carrier/

2.2. Experimental procedure
In this paper, the CLG experiments are conducted in a ﬁxed bed
reactor. Before experiment, 99.99% N 2is ventilated into the ﬁxed
bed reactor for 20 min to maintain the inert atmosphere. After
maintained at 800/C14C, 5 g sample is placed into the center of the
ﬁxed bed reactor for 30 min. Meanwhile, distilled water with a
certain ﬂow rate is injected into the ﬁxed bed reactor. During
experiment, the ﬂue gas is measured by Gas Chromatograph after
condensation. After CLG, the reduced oxygen carrier is detected by
SEM, XRD, BET, TG and O 2-TPO.
The calculations of four evaluation parameters are shown in our
previous paper [ 29], including gas production, LHV, gasi ﬁcation
efﬁciency and carbon conversion ef ﬁciency.

E:\\PINNs-Research\\Searched Articles\\Chemical looping gasification of biochar to produce hydrogen-rich.pdf,3,1,"impregnation method and coprecipitation method) are studied to
obtain the effects on CLG performance under a molar ratio of
Al:Fe ¼2:1 and S/C of 0.5.
The effect of preparation methods on gas concentration and gas
production is shown in Fig. 1 (a). The trends of gas concentration are
similar under four methods. The highest is H 2(61.53% e65.18%),
followed by CO 2(21.99% e25.70%) and CO (6.51% e11.75%). The
lowest is CH 4(only 2.10% e2.95%). This phenomenon is mainly
because 1) water-gas shift reaction (CO þH2O/H2þCO2) and
carbon gasi ﬁcation reaction (C þH2O/H2þCO, C þCO2/2CO)
are enhanced with the help of steam, resulting in the highest H 2
concentration and more than twice that of CO 2. 2) under the supply
of lattice oxygen by oxygen carrier, part of C/CO will be converted
into CO 2, thus CO concentration is lower than that of CO 2. 3) in CLG,
CH4is mainly produced by biochar pyrolysis process. As shown in
Table 1 , a low content of H (only 3.78%) and volatile (14.76%) lead to
the lowest CH 4concentration.
However, gas production is different among four methods. The
highest is coprecipitation method (0.93 Nm3/kg), followed by
impregnation method (0.76 Nm3/kg) and single Fe 2O3method
(0.73 Nm3/kg), while Fe 2O3/Al2O3mechanical blending method
(0.70 Nm3/kg) is the lowest. As a physical process, the dispersion
structure will hinder the release of lattice oxygen under the me-
chanical blending method [ 22]. Therefore, gas production of this
method is the lowest, even lower than that of single Fe 2O3method.
However, as shown in the XRD results of Fig. 1 (b), Fe 2O3is reduced
into FeO under single Fe 2O3method after CLG process. FeO is
believed to easily form agglomeration and sintering [ 23], resulting
in a low gas production under single Fe 2O3method. In addition, as a
chemical process, the active component Fe will be evenly distrib-
uted on Al 2O3, leading to a high gas production under coprecipi-
tation and impregnation method. Furthermore, as shown in the
XRD results of",608,"[ 0.0156427   0.00038948  0.05053053 ... -0.02032101 -0.00743452

E:\\PINNs-Research\\Searched Articles\\Chemical looping gasification of biochar to produce hydrogen-rich.pdf,3,2,"Fig. 1 (b), wider diffraction peaks are detected under
coprecipitation method, indicating that oxygen carrier of this
method has a higher dispersion and a smaller particle. Further,
FeAl 2O4with a better crystal structure and thermal stability [ 30]i s
detected under coprecipitation method after CLG process, which
illustrates that all Fe3þare reduced into Fe2þ, achieving a complete
redox ability without sintering. Moreover, as shown in Table 2 ,a
smaller surface area and porosity is detected under coprecipitation
method, which is conducive to the uniform distribution and
stronger combination between carrier and active component [ 31].
Therefore, oxygen carrier prepared by coprecipitation method has a
highest performance in gas production.
The effect of preparation methods on ef ﬁciency and LHV is
shown in Fig. 1 (c). There is a positive correlation between LHV and
the concentration of combustible gas (H 2, CO and CH 4) based on the
formulation of LHV. The highest concentration of combustible gas is
obtained under coprecipitation method (78.01%), followed by
impregnation method (76.12%). Therefore, the highest LHV is
coprecipitation method (14.30 MJ/Nm3), followed by impregnation
method (14.24 MJ/Nm3). And the lowest is single Fe 2O3method
(13.75 MJ/Nm3).
As shown in Fig. 1 (c), the lowest carbon conversion ef ﬁciency
(30.33%) and gasi ﬁcation ef ﬁciency (44.78%) are obtained under
Fe2O3/Al2O3mechanical blending method because the release of
lattice oxygen from Fe 2O3is weakened by the obstruction of carrier
Al2O3under mechanical blending, sacri ﬁcing partial ef ﬁciency to
prevent the deep reduction of Fe 2O3and alleviate sintering of ox-
ygen carrier [ 32]. The carbon conversion ef ﬁciency (34.48%) and
gasiﬁcation ef ﬁciency (45.46%) of single Fe 2O3method are slightly
higher than that of mechanical blending method, but the sintering
caused by the deep reduction under this method is not conducive to
long-term cycle reaction. Among these four preparation methods,
the highe",540,"[ 0.02731482 -0.02206019  0.04958334 ...  0.00051866 -0.00096861

E:\\PINNs-Research\\Searched Articles\\Chemical looping gasification of biochar to produce hydrogen-rich.pdf,3,3,"st carbon conversion ef ﬁciency (40.68%) and gasi ﬁcationefﬁciency (60.06%) are obtained under coprecipitation method,
followed by impregnation method (36.81% and 50.49%). This is
mainly because smaller surface area and porosity are detected as
shown in Table 2 , indicating the uniform distribution and combi-
nation between carrier and Fe 2O3are better in these two methods.
Moreover, compared with the single Fe 2O3and mechanical
blending method, oxygen carriers have a higher dispersion and
smaller particles under these two methods because wider diffrac-
tion peaks are shown in Fig. 1 (b). In addition, according to the XRD
result, FeAl 2O4behaves a better crystal structure and the carrier
Al2O3behaves a more prominent effect under these two methods.
As a result, better carbon conversion ef ﬁciency and gasi ﬁcation
efﬁciency are obtained under coprecipitation and impregnation
method. Furthermore, the interaction between the active compo-
nent Fe and carrier is stronger under coprecipitation method [ 31],
obtaining a better reaction performance. Further, two peaks of
Fe2O3reduction [ 33] are shown in Fig. 1 (d) under these two
methods. Meanwhile, an earlier and more hydrogen consumption
is detected under coprecipitation method, which indicates that
oxygen carrier of coprecipitation method presents a stronger Fe 2O3
reduction and higher O 2release performance, resulting in a higher
and easier redox activity. In addition, as shown in Fig. 1 (e), after
CLG, smaller particles and more evenly dispersion are observed
under coprecipitation method, which is consistent with the XRD
results. However, a slight sintering and inferior dispersion are
observed under impregnation method. Therefore, oxygen carrier of
coprecipitation method has a better performance in CLG.
Based on the comprehensive consideration, the best oxygen
carrier preparation method is coprecipitation method for CLG in
this study.

method is chosen for oxygen carriers preparation in the following
sections. In order to investigate the optimal Fe loading, the effect of
Fe loadings prepared on carrier is studied with a S/C of 0.5 in this
section under the molar ratios of Fe:Al ¼0.5:2, 1:2, 1.5:2, 2:2 and
2.5:2, respectively.
The effect of Fe loadings on gas concentration is shown in
Fig. 2 (a). With the increase of Fe:Al from 0.5:2 to 2.5:2, the con-
centration of H 2and CO 2increases respectively by 8.50% and 3.85%,
while the concentration of CO and CH 4decreases accordingly. This
phenomenon is mainly because 1) there is more active component
Fe2O3loaded on carrier Al 2O3with the increase of Fe loading. As a
catalyst, more active component shows stronger catalytic effect,
promoting the water-gas shift reaction (CO þH2O/H2þCO2),
carbon gasi ﬁcation reaction (C þH2O/H2þCO) and reforming
reaction (CH 4þH2O/3H2þCO) during CLG process. Thus,
higher Fe loading produces more H 2. 2) with the increase of Fe
loading, Fe 2O3provides adequate oxygen and enhances the reactions
of CO þFe2O3/CO2þFe3O4,C H 4þ4Fe 2O3/2H2OþCO2þ
8FeOand C þ2Fe 2O3/CO2þ4FeO[ 23,34], leading to an in-
crease of CO 2and decrease of CO and CH 4.
As shown in Fig. 2 (a), with the increase of Fe:Al from 0.5:2 to
2.5:2, gas production increases ﬁrstly and then decreases, obtaining
the highest gas production of 1.09 Nm3/kg at 1.5 Fe loading. With
the increase of Fe:Al from 0.5:2 to 1.5:2, the increase of active
component Fe 2O3provides more lattice oxygen and catalytic effect,
strengthening the gasi ﬁcation reaction and gas production. How-
ever, gas production decreases when Fe:Al increases from 1.5:2 to
2.5:2. It is mainly because 1) the BET surface area increases
continually from 6.35 m2/g to 11.51 m2/g when Fe:Al increases from
0.5:2 to 2.5:2, which indicates that the distribution of particles is
uneven and the combination between Fe 2O3and Al 2O3becomesZ. Hu, Z. Miao, H. Chen et al. Journal of the Energy Institute 94 (2021) 157 e166",677,"[ 0.0213985  -0.02082901  0.03576918 ... -0.00130787 -0.01761802

increase of Fe loading, the intensity of Fe 2O3increases accordingly
while the intensity of Al 2O3decreases obviously. This XRD analysis
reveals that more Fe 2O3covers on Al 2O3, weakening the support
effect of carrier Al 2O3. 3) as shown in the H 2-TPR results of Fig. 2 (c),
with the increase of Fe loading, the temperature of hydrogen con-
sumption peaks becomes higher, which means that Fe 2O3reduc-
tion and O 2release become harder and need more energy to react
under higher Fe loading condition. In other words, high Fe loadingweakens the interaction between Fe
2O3and carrier Al 2O3. There-
fore, the excessive Fe loading exceeds the carrier capacity, weak-

which indicates that Ca- and Fe-based oxygen carrier are conducive
to the formation of H 2-rich syngas. Thereinto, owing to a strong
performance of CO 2capture [ 36], the CO 2concentration of Ca-based
oxygen carrier is the lowest (18.74%), increasing accordingly the H 2

The highest gas production is obtained from Fe-based oxygen
carrier (1.09 Nm3/kg), followed by Ca-based oxygen carrier (1.08
Nm3/kg). This is because the active component CaO plays a role of
catalyst in CLG to increase the production of CO and H 2[37],
improving the gasi ﬁcation ef ﬁciency and gas production [ 38].

Substantial deactivation and sintering of Cu-based oxygen carrier
occur at high temperature due to the low melting point of CuO and
Cu [ 39]. Thus, Cu-based oxygen carrier produces a low gas

The effect of active components (Cu, Mn, Ca and Fe) on ef ﬁciency

70.57% is obtained from Fe-based oxygen carrier among these four

tion of Fe 2O3(Fe2O3/Fe3O4/FeO/Fe) provides much lattice
oxygen [ 23], showing high activity of oxygen carrier. Moreover, as

enhances the tar cracking, increasing the production of CO and H 2

owing to a strong performance of CO 2capture, the highest LHV of

Fe- and Ca-based oxygen carrier. The highest carbon conversion
efﬁciency is obtained from Cu-based oxygen carrier because of the
high oxygen transport capacity and biochar gasi ﬁcation reactivity
[35]. However, as shown in the O 2-TPO results of Fig. 3 (d), the
highest carbon deposition is detected on Cu-based oxygen carrier,
covering partially the active site on the oxygen carrier. Moreover,
the low melting point of Cu/CuO is easy to cause sintering. There-
fore, the high carbon deposition and sintering lead to the lowest gas

3.4. Effects of Ca loadings on CLG
According to the discussion of section 3.3, Fe and Ca-based ox-
ygen carrier show a high gasi ﬁcation ef ﬁciency and hydrogen

synergistic effect on CLG performance. In order to investigate the

molar ratios of Ca:Fe:Al ¼0.25:1.5:2, 0.5:1.5:2, 1:1.5:2 and 1.5:1.5:2,

because the CO 2capture and catalytic effect of Ca help to enhance
CO production and reduce CO 2production. However, as shown in
the XRD results of Fig. 4 (b), more FeO and less Fe 3O4is detected
with the increase of Ca loading, indicating that Ca promotes the
deep reduction of Fe 2O3to release more lattice oxygen, which will
react with CO to produce CO 2. Therefore, the concentrations of CO
and CO 2exhibit the tendency shown in Fig. 4 (a). When Ca loadingincreases from 0.25 to 1.5, H 2concentration and gas production

loading achieves the highest H 2concentration of 64.10%, the
highest gas production of 1.12 Nm3/kg and the lowest CH 4con-
centration of 1.06%. This tendency can be explained that Ca is
conducive to the tar cracking, promoting more gas production and
resulting in a higher H 2concentration and lower CH 4concentration
under a high Ca loading. However, the excessive Ca loading covers
partial active site of Fe, inhibiting the reactivity of Fe-based oxygen
carrier. Meanwhile, as shown in the XRD results of Fig. 4 (b), more
FeO is detected with the increase of Ca loading, which will be easier
to sinter and weaker the reaction under high temperature. There-
fore, increase of CH 4concentration, decrease of H 2concentration

efﬁciency of 71.83% and carbon conversion ef ﬁciency of 48.22%. The
reasons can be explained as follows. Firstly, as shown in Table 3 , the
surface area and porosity becomes smaller when Ca loading in-
creases from 0.25 to 1.0, which indicates that the distribution of
active components becomes more uniform and the combination
between carrier and active components becomes stronger [ 31],
improving the CLG performance. However, the distribution and
combination become weaker since the surface area and porosity

ondly, Ca can catalyze the tar cracking and biochar conversion,
promoting the gasi ﬁcation process and gas production. Thirdly, as
shown in the TG results of Fig. 4 (d), many carbon deposition and
unreacted biochar are observed under low Ca loadings of 0.25 and
0.5, revealing low ef ﬁciency and poor conversion. Particularly, the
moderate Ca loading of 1.0 displays the lowest carbon deposition
and unreacted biochar, showing a great reactivity. However, the
excessive Ca loading of 1.5 increases carbon deposition andunreacted biochar, which is because the excessive Ca partially
covers on Fe, weakening the conversion of active site Fe. Therefore,
the gasi ﬁcation ef ﬁciency and carbon conversion ef ﬁciency in-
crease ﬁrstly and then decrease with the increase of Ca loading
from 0.25 to 1.5.
Based on the comprehensive consideration of CLG performance
in gas concentration, gas production, oxygen carrier and ef ﬁ-
ciencies, the optimal Ca loading in Fe-based oxygen carrier is

production and ef ﬁciencies are studied under the S/C of 0.25, 0.50,
0.75, 1.00, 1.25, 1.50, 1.75 and 2.00, respectively.
The effect of S/C on gas concentration is shown in Fig. 5 (a).
When S/C increases from 0.25 to 2.00, CO
2and H 2concentrations
increase, while CO and CH 4concentrations decrease. This is mainly
because the increase of steam will promote the carbon gasi ﬁcation
reaction (C þH2O/H2þCO), water-gas shift reaction (CO þ
H2O/H2þCO2) and reforming reaction (CH 4þH2O/3H2þ
CO, Tar þH2O/H2þCO=CO2=CH4)[41] during CLG process.
Therefore, the increase of S/C will increase the concentration of CO 2
and H 2but decrease the concentration of CO and CH 4. In addition,
as shown in Fig. 5 (b), LHV shows an approximately increasing trendwith the increase of S/C, which is positively correlated with the
concentration of combustible gas.
As shown in Fig. 5 , gas production, gasi ﬁcation ef ﬁciency and
carbon conversion ef ﬁciency increase ﬁrstly and then decrease with
the increase of S/C. When S/C increases from 0.25 to 1.50, gas pro-
duction, gasi ﬁcation ef ﬁciency and carbon conversion ef ﬁciency in-
crease obviously by 139.59%, 144.19% and 106.70%, respectively. This

biochar conversion (Tar þH2O/H2þCO=CO2=CH4andC þ
H2O/H2þCO), producing more combustible gas. 2) after pro-
vided lattice oxygen, Fe 2O3converts into the reduced oxygen carrier
FeO/Fe 3O4. The increase of steam will react with the reduced oxygen
carrier FeO/Fe 3O4to form the oxidized oxygen carrier Fe 2O3and
convert steam into H 2(H2OþFeO=Fe3O4/H2þFe3O4=Fe2O3).
The oxidized oxygen carrier Fe 2O3will continue to provide lattice
oxygen for the biochar conversion (C þFe3O4=Fe2O3/CO=CO2þ
FeO=Fe3O4), increasing gas production. Therefore, gas production,
gasiﬁcation ef ﬁciency and carbon conversion ef ﬁciency increase
obviously with the increase of S/C from 0.25 to 1.50.
However, when S/C continues to increase from 1.50 to 2.00, gas
production, gasi ﬁcation ef ﬁciency and carbon conversion ef ﬁciency
decrease clearly by 17.38%, 19.99% and 31.65%, respectively. This is
mainly because 1) the excessive steam ventilates into the reactor
and absorbs more heat from reactor, decreasing the reaction tem-
perature. Thus, the excessive steam reduces the reaction perfor-
mance. 2) the excessive steam will correspondingly increase the gas
ﬂow of reactor, shortening the reaction time between steam and

and ef ﬁciency. Therefore, gas production, gasi ﬁcation ef ﬁciency and
carbon conversion ef ﬁciency decrease clearly with the increase of
S/C from 1.50 to 2.00.
Based on the comprehensive consideration of CLG performance
in gas concentration, gas production, oxygen carrier and ef ﬁ-
ciencies, 1.50 is the optimal S/C to achieve high H 2concentration of

ating parameters were investigated in this study. The results show that an increase in operating pa-
rameters could favor the process performance. Carbon conversion ef ﬁciency and the yields accelerate at
high operating conditions. Carbon conversion ef ﬁciency showed a maximum value of 91.42% for iron ore
at the ratio of oxygen carrier-to-biomass of 6, while the gas yield reaches the peak at SBR of 1.4 for
ilmenite. The addition of steam in biomass chemical looping gasi ﬁcation improves hydrogen production
and syngas quality in the product gas. Despite ilmenite provides better performance for hydrogen pro-
duction, it characterizes by a lower reactivity compared to iron ore. It is also found that iron ore performs
better at lower values of steam-to-biomass ratios and temperatures, while ilmenite shows good results athigher those parameters.

challenges from biomass ’s inherent properties such as low energy
density, high moisture content, and complex ash components,
biomass is abundant, widely available, and renewable. Moreover,
the utilization of biomass for power and heat production has an
advantage over other renewable sources such as solar energy, wind
energy, and hydropower, etc. due to its low dependence on site and
climate [ 3].
Chemical looping gasi ﬁcation (CLG) is a novel concept to gasify
feedstocks into syngas, which can be used to generate power or
produce chemicals and fuels. Biomass gasi ﬁcation using chemical
looping technology is an innovative biomass technology due to its
advantages such as high-quality syngas production, lower CO 2emissions, and higher hydrogen production ef ﬁciency. Biomass
chemical looping gasi ﬁcation (BCLG) shares the principles with
chemical looping technology. A simplistic mechanism of biomass
chemical looping gasi ﬁcation is illustrated in Fig. 1 .
The BCLG system mainly consists of two reactors: the air reactor
and the fuel reactor. The metals/metal oxid",262,"[-0.00264101  0.05444501  0.02360286 ...  0.00105091 -0.0235913

reactor at sub-stoichiometric quantities of metal oxides (Me xOy)t o

be supplied to the fuel reactor to enhance reforming reactions and
char gasi ﬁcation. In the air reactor, the reduced form of oxygen

air. The general chemical reactions that take place in the air reactor
and the fuel reactor are presented in Reaction (R1) and (R2),respectively.

Fluidized bed reactors are advantageous for the power genera-
tion and production of chemicals due to their continuous operation
and process scalability. Bubbling ﬂuidized bed gasi ﬁers have high
simplicity in con ﬁguration and process operation, and it is suitable
for various particle sizes and types of feedstock. In bubbling ﬂuid-
ized bed reactors, the solid biomass material is introduced into a
reactor through which is ﬂuidized using an upward ﬂow (air, ox-
ygen, steam, carbon dioxide, or mixture at a suf ﬁcient ﬂow rate to
support their weight (incipient ﬂuidization)). The longer residence
time of fuel particles and the lower particle entrainment offers a
certain advantage over the other types of ﬂuidized bed reactors.
Many previous studies have been carried out to evaluate the
performance of oxygen carrier materials in the BCLG process
[4e11]. Various transition metal oxides and metal sulfates such as
Ni, Cu, Co, Mn, Fe show good characteristics as feasible oxygen
carriers for BCLG due to their favorable reductive/oxidative ther-
modynamic properties [ 12]. Compared to other oxygen carriers, the
iron-based oxygen carriers are the most attractive oxygen carriersdue to their low cost, environmentally-friendly issues, high me-
chanical strength, and high-temperature stability [ 13,14]. Further-
more, metallic iron is expected to promote C-C and C-H bond
cleavage [ 15], resulting in more tar decomposition in the presence
of iron o",419,"[ 0.00852888  0.04325404  0.02114669 ...  0.01141084 -0.00743891

carriers that have been widely used as an oxygen carrier in variouschemical looping conversion processes (mainly in the combustion
process). Iron ore with Fe
2O3as the active component ( >80 wt%) is
an abundant low-cost source. The iron ore was applied as an oxygen
carrier for CLG of biomass char [ 16], improving the char conversion
rate and showing stable reactivity after 20 cycles. In the chemical
looping conversions of solid fuels, Fe 2O3is mostly reduced to Fe 3O4
in aﬂuidized bed reactor due to thermodynamic limitation, and its
relatively low oxygen transfer capacity [ 17,18]. The ilmenite is an
iron-titanium oxide mineral, basically composed of iron and tita-
nium with the idealized formula FeTiO 3(FeO.TiO 2). The iron oxides
and titanium oxide can be considered as the active component and
support material in ilmenite. The ilmenite mainly contains Fe2þand
can be fully oxidized to Fe3þin the air at 900 e1200/C14C to improve
its oxygen transfer capacity (OTC). Calcination temperature could
inﬂuence the ilmenite transformation. The temperatures below
800/C14C could favor the formation of Fe 2O3and TiO 2, while Ilmenite
could be transformed into pseudobrookite Fe 2TiO 5and TiO 2at
temperatures above 900/C14C[19,20]. Fe 3Ti3O10(Fe3O4.3TiO 2) could
be the possible intermediate phases of ilmenite and pseudo-
brookite [ 21]. The ilmenite is intensively used as oxygen carrier,
showing good stability and reactivity in chemical looping com-bustion applications [ 21e26].

of understanding of the behavior of oxygen carriers in the gasi ﬁer
have hindered its large-scale commercial applications. Tars
released from biomass gasi ﬁcation, the effects of operating pa-
rameters in a ﬂuidized bed gasi ﬁer on the behavior of oxygen car-
riers as well as the performance of BCLG, and the feasibility of
biomass-based CLG using Fe-based oxygen carriers, etc. have
been concerned. However, there are a limited number of studies on
biomass chemical looping gasi ﬁcation in ﬂuidized bed reactors in
the literature, especially using torre ﬁed biomass as a feedstock.
Additionally, very few studies on ﬂuidization regimes and the effect
of gas velocity in BCLG can be found.
In the present work, experimental investigations of chemical
looping gasi ﬁcation of torre ﬁed woodchips were carried out in a
bubbling ﬂuidized bed test rig at a negative gauge pressure. Iron ore
and ilmenite were selected as an oxygen carrier in this study. A
series of CLG investigations were performed to evaluate the in-
ﬂuences of gasi ﬁcation temperature, steam-to-biomass mass ratio
(SBR), oxygen carrier-to-biomass ratio (OBR), and super ﬁcial ve-
locity on the hydrogen production and the process performance.

2. Materials and method
2.1. Materials
Woodchips, torre ﬁed at 250/C14C and atmospheric pressure, were
used as feedstock in the experimental investigations. Detailed in-
formation on the biomass torrefaction experimental setup has been
described in a dissertation [ 27]. The torre ﬁed woodchips were
ground and sieved to a particle size of 200 e850mm. The proximate
analysis of all samples was conducted following the DIN norms
18122, 18123, and 18134 standard test methods for ash, volatile
matter, ﬁxed carbon, and moisture determination, respectively. The
ultimate analysis was carried out using an elemental analyzer
(Elementar vario MACRO cube, measurement error <0.1%). The
feedstock characteristics are illustrated in Table 1 . The determina-
tion of the heating value of the feedstock was performed in an
isoperibolic, according to the DIN norms 51900 standard test
method.
Ilmenite and iron ore are used as oxygen carriers in the in-
vestigations. To improve the reactivity of oxygen carrier materials,
the ilmenite was calcinated at 850/C14C in the air atmosphe",351,"[ 0.00986896  0.00320487  0.01437552 ... -0.00688254  0.01581188

about 2 h in a bubbling bed reactor, while the iron ore has been
crushed, dried, and calcinated at 950/C14C[24]. The physical proper-
ties and chemical composition of these oxygen carriers are shown
inTable 2 .
The bed materials are used in a ﬂuidized bed reactor to create
ﬂuidizing fundamentals. In the biomass gasi ﬁcation investigation
(oxygen carrier-to-biomass ratio (OBR) of 0), silica sand is selected
as an inert bed material due to its mechanical properties and
neutral role in biomass gasi ﬁcation. The used F34 quartz sand of
Quarzwerke company has particle diameters in the range of
125e355mm and a density of 2650 kg/m3. A reduced form of ox-
ygen carriers is used in the BCLG as bed materials in the bubbling
ﬂuidized bed test rig.
2.2. Fluidized bed gasi ﬁer
The steam gasi ﬁcation experiments were carried out in a pilot-
scale bubbling bed reactor, which is schematically shown in Fig. 2 .The experimental pilot is equipped with a complete control system
including ﬂow control, feeding control system, pressure control,
electrical heating system, temperature measurement points inside
the reactor. The gasi ﬁer consists of a circular column with an in-
ternal diameter of 54.5 mm and a height of 550 mm, and a porous
plate as gas distribution at the bottom. Temperature and pressure
are measured at heights of 90 mm, 350 mm, and 550 mm. The
reactor is externally heated by two electrical heating elements. The
feedstock is continuously fed from a hopper int",379,"[-0.00404354  0.0366369   0.01802437 ... -0.00973512  0.00161435

90 mm height through a screw feeder. A mixture of gases is pre-
heated to 300/C14C and injected into the reactor through a porous
plate. The product gas on the top of the reactor is heated up to
110/C14C to prevent the moisture and tars from condensing. A small
amount of the product gas extracted from the top of the reactor is to
measure continuously the volume fraction of the major compo-
nents at a gas analysis unit. A jet pump to maintain negative gauge
pressure inside the reactor spews the rest of the product gas out.
2.3. Experimental procedure
The torre ﬁed woodchips and oxygen carriers are mixed at a
known ratio and contained in a hopper, in which the agitation and
screw feeder is set to the desired feed rate. Meanwhile, 0.05 Nm3/h
of N 2is injected into the hopper to create an inert environment
inside the hopper. Before starting the experiment, a negative gauge
pressure inside the reactor is generated by turning the jet pump on.
The reactor is ﬁlled up with 800 g of sand (for OBR of 0) or with the
reduced form of oxygen carrier as bed material and ﬂuidized with a
stream of N 2during the heating period up to the experiment
temperature. When the desired temperature is reached, water is
evaporated for steam generation, and N 2is added to yield a total gas
ﬂow. The mixture of steam and N 2is pre-heated to 300/C14C before
injection into the reactor. As soon as the temperature and pressure
in the reactor reach a stable condition, the feeds",369,"[ 0.01257886  0.01198168  0.02331536 ... -0.01832194  0.04004906

continuously at 1 g/min of biomass ﬂow rate. The steam-to-
biomass mass ratio can be varied by changing the mass ﬂow rate
of steam while keeping the biomass ﬂow rate constant. Once stable
gas compositions have been achieved for 30 min, all data are
recorded. The reported volume fractions of the gas composition are
the average values on a dry and nitrogen-free basis.
In this study, torre ﬁed woodchips are gasi ﬁed with steam as
gasiﬁcation agent, and ilmenite and iron ore as oxygen carriers.
Additionally, steam gasi ﬁcation of torre ﬁed biomass is also con-
ducted at 850/C14C with oxygen carrier-to-biomass ratio (OBR) of zero
and sand as bed material. The experiments are carried out to
investigate the effect of operating parameters such as the ratio of
steam-to-biomass (SBR), operating temperature, the ratio of oxy-
gen carrier-to-biomass (OBR), and super ﬁcial velocity on hydrogen

The gasi ﬁcation performance is evaluated through key variables
such as the calori ﬁc value of the product gas, hydrogen fraction and

derived from the data obtained during gasi ﬁcation.

The experiments were performed using a pilot-scale bubbling
ﬂuidized bed reactor, as shown in Fig. 2 , to investigate the gasi ﬁ-
cation performance under various oxygen carrier-to-biomass ratios

concentration of CH 4is relatively lower with maintaining around

at an OBR of 6. Consequently, a decrease in syngas yield and gas
yield is found with an increase of OBR due to a gradual decrease in
yields of CO and CH 4. The result also indicates that the carbon
conversion ef ﬁciency rises in the range of OBR. At OBR of 0, the
carbon conversion ef ﬁciency is about 63.95%, and this ﬁgure in-
creases gradually, reaching 83.99% at OBR of 4, to a peak of 85.52%

around 20% in the same period.
The result of this investigation shows that the amount of oxygen
carriers used in the BCLG signi ﬁcantly in ﬂuences the process per-
formance, especially the H 2production. Both BCLG tests using the
two oxygen carriers reveal a considerable reduction in the yield and
concentration of H 2as well as a great increase in those of CO 2with
an increase of OBR. This can be explained by the higher amount of
oxygen carrier used that can provide more oxygen source forTable 3

Additionally, an increase of CO 2and H 2O contents in the reactor can
favor the char gasi ﬁcation reactions (R6 and R7) and cracking re-
actions, which enhance biomass conversion or carbon conversion
efﬁciency. Therefore, it can be suggested that high syngas produc-
tion is obtained at low OBRs.
It is noteworthy that the rate of decrease in the concentration of
H2is higher than that of CO and CH 4. These ﬁgures are 12.83%,

Fe2O3with those gaseous fuels has the following order:
H2>CO>CH4[17]. Therefore, the amount of H 2oxidized by Fe 2O3
is higher than the others. Although the theoretical oxygen transport
capacity of iron ore is lower than that of ilmenite (~3.3% and ~4%),

3.2. Effect of gasi ﬁcation temperature
The gasi ﬁcation temperature is crucial for the performance of
the BCLG process. In this study, the experiments were carried out at
four temperatures in the range of 750/C14Ce900/C14C with 50/C14C in-
crements. Due to the small reactor diameter and long operating
time, the OBR of 3 was selected in the variation of temperatures,
and SBR of 1.0 was used for these investigations. The effects of
gasiﬁcation temperature on the performance of the BCLG using iron
ore and ilmenite as oxygen carriers are given in Tables 4 and 5 ,
respectively. Additionally, Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 show the variations of
the gas concentrations and syngas yield as a function of gasi ﬁcation
temperature.
Generally, these ﬁgures show that the concentration of H 2from
the BCLG with iron ore and ilmenite decreases slightly, while there
is an increase in CO content in both cases corresponding to elevated
temperature in the reactor. It can be observed that higher gasi ﬁ-
cation temperatures generate more syngas yield and gas yield,

noteworthy that the gasi ﬁcation temperature shows little impact

range of temperature for the BCLG using iron ore, whereas this

well explained due to a series of complex and completing reactions
including exothermic and endothermic reactions as well as solid/
gas and gas/gas reactions in the BCLG [ 31,32]. It can be seen that the
CO concentration rises, while there is a slight decrease in the
contents of H 2and CO 2with the temperature increase. This can be
attributed to Le Chatelier ’s principle (elevated temperatures favor
the reactants in exothermic reactions and the products in endo-
thermic reactions). Therefore, high temperature promotes the
endothermic reactions (R5-R7), resulting in the enriched H 2and CO
contents and the reduction in CO 2. Additionally, combustible gases
can be also oxidized by iron ore and ilmenite through R8 eR10 to
produce CO 2and H 2O. However, it is due to the stronger reducibility
of oxygen carriers with H 2, an amount of H 2oxidized is more than
that of CO and CH 4. Therefore, the content of H 2decreases relatively
compared to other components. Furthermore, the increasing tem-

steam per mass of biomass fed into the reactor [ 31]. Besides the
gasiﬁcation temperature, SBR is a key parameter in ﬂuencing
strongly on the performance of the BCLG, especially H 2production

provides not only hydrogen for high-quality syngas production but

increasing the SBR improves the ratios of H
2/CO 2and H 2/CO (the
rates of increase accelerate, being about 1.4 for H 2/CO 2and 2.15 for
H2/CO at SBR of 1.4). This trend indicates that the fraction of H 2
increases relatively in the product gas compared to the other spe-cies corresponding to a higher amount of steam used. The yields of
syngas and product gas obtained are improved considerably with
about 15.9% and 10.2% at SBR of 1.4 higher than those at SBR of 0.9.
These increases are due to the signi ﬁcant rise in the yields of H

over, the rise in the contents of H 2and CH 4results in an increase in

The experimental results using ilmenite as oxygen carrier arepresented in Fig. 8 and Table 5 . Overall, the presence of steam
shows a strong in ﬂuence on syngas production. The content of H 2
increases by about 3.63%, while its yield at SBR of 1.4 is 27.32%
higher than that at SBR of 0.9. Furthermore, the ratios of H 2/CO and

also promotes the yields of syngas and product gas. It is found that
the yields of syngas and product gas obtained are getting 17.97%

result, there is a considerable increase in H 2production and a
relative reduction in the concentrations of other gas species.Additionally, the water-gas shift reaction is promoted by the higher
steam content that would be accompanied by a reduction in the
fraction of CO. It is noted that there is little variation in the content
and yield of CH
4in the range of 0.9 e1.4 because its fraction is very
small compared to other components and it mainly derives from
the devolatilization of torre ﬁed woodchips. The char gasi ﬁcation
reactions and the heavier hydrocarbon cracking reactions are
favored by the high content of steam in the reactor, increasing the

excess steam may cause a reduction in the temperature of the BCLG
since the steam absorbs a lot of heat, resulting in a decline in BCLG
performance.
It is noted that the investigation using ilmenite performs better
in terms of H 2production, gas yield, LHV, and ef ﬁciencies compared
to those from BCLG using iron ore. Interestingly to note that the
carbon conversion ef ﬁciency from the test using iron ore is higher
at low SBR, but ilmenite shows better performance at a higher
amount of steam. Additionally, the test with ilmenite also shows a
higher rate of increase in gas yield with 16.82% in the range of SBR
compared to that using iron ore with 10.24%. It could be concluded
that the steam content strongly affects the performance of ilmenite
in the BCLG process.

ponents obtained are higher at higher gas velocities, resulting in

has a small effect on the fraction of species in the product gas, but
the carbon conversion of biomass gasi ﬁcation and the yield of gas is
improved. As the same tendency with other variables, the results
with ilmenite indicate better performance in terms of H 2produc-
tion and gas yield in every gas velocity.
Those trends may be attributed to the effect of super ﬁcial ve-
locity on the hydrodynamics of bed material in the BCLG. In this
investigation, only the gas velocity varied, while other variables
were ﬁxed. Therefore, there is a limiting factor, which can affect
chemical equilibrium in the BCLG. Consequently, the variation of
component concentrations in the product gas can be neglected. As
discussed above, an increase in gas velocity can enhance the gas-
solid mixing, the heat and mass transfer in a bubbling bed reactor",264,"[ 8.3107356e-04 -6.8238580e-05  2.3913279e-02 ...  7.8568766e-03

gas velocities, resulting in a slight increase in the content of CO and
gas yield, and a small reduction in CO 2concentration. However,
when the gas velocity is too high, the bed material can transit into
slugging, turbulent, or fast ﬂuidization regimes. Therefore, the
evaluation of the effect of gas velocity in a bubbling bed reactor on
the performance of the BLCG is crucial to select the suitable gas
velocities for stable operations while achieving the desired results.

This section compares the performance of two oxygen carriers
in the BCLG process through their results evaluated in the previous
sections. Generally, the ilmenite performs better than the iron ore
in terms of the content and yield of H 2with a greater percentage of
H2content from 0.98 to 4.84%, whereas the iron ore produces more

locity). Additionally, carbon conversion ef ﬁciency for the iron ore is
higher than that with ilmenite in a range of 1.06 e8.94%, excluding
the case of SBR. Therefore, it may be concluded that the reactivity of
the iron ore is higher than that of the ilmenite in this work. Ac-
cording to the previous studies, iron ore as an oxygen carrier has a
theoretical oxygen transport capacity (OTC) of around 3.3%, which
is lower compared to that of the ilmenite with 4% [ 24]. However,
the study ’s results show here the opposite trend. It can be attrib-
uted to the calcination temperature of the ilmenite, which strongly
inﬂuences its reactivity (ilmenite was oxidized in air at 850/C14C,
while iron ore was calcinated at 950/C14C). The iron ore mainly con-
sists of Fe 2O3as the active component with <80 wt%. In a ﬂuidized
bed reactor, the iron ore is mainly reduced from Fe 2O3to Fe 3O4by
solid fuels because of thermodynamic limitation [ 17]. The ilmenite
mainly contains iron oxides and titanium oxide as the active
components. The raw ilmenite largely comprises Fe2þ, which can be

nation temperature could signi ﬁcantly in ﬂuence the ilmenite
transformation. The calcination of ilmenite at a temperature below
800/C14C could promote the formation of Fe 2O3and TiO 2, while
ilmenite can be transformed to pseudobrookite Fe 2TiO 5at tem-
peratures above 900/C14C. In the range between 770 and 900/C14C, the
Fe2Ti3O9phase is existent after the oxidation process [ 17,20].

formed lower reduction kinetics, but it showed a greater OTC
compared to other ilmenite phases. Their results also indicated that

ilmenite is also affected during the calcination due to its crystalline
properties and its surface area. As a result, the calcination tem-
perature strongly in ﬂuences the performance of ilmenite in the
chemical looping gasi ﬁcation process. The effect of oxygen carrier
on the BCLG on the H 2content is the greatest with 12.83 e14.62%,
while the content of CH 4shows the lowest difference with around
0.9% in the range of OBR in the cases of two oxygen carriers. The
reaction rate of H 2with iron-based oxygen carriers is higher than
that of CO. By contrast, the CH 4shows the lowest reactivity with
this type of oxygen carrier. This order is in good agreement with the
literature data [ 12,17].
4. Conclusion
Chemical looping gasi ﬁcation is considered as a potential pro-
cess to produce high-quality syngas from biomass. Among various
types of oxygen carriers, iron-based oxygen carriers have been
intensively used in chemical looping conversion processes due totheir low price, environmentally-friendly issues, high mechanical
strength, and high-temperature stability, despite the relatively low
kinetics and low oxygen transport capacity. In this study, the in-

experimentally. The highlighted remarks of this study are as
follows:
1. The oxygen carrier is a key factor in the BCLG process. The
amount of oxygen carrier used in the gasi ﬁer strongly affects the
performance of the CLG process. An increase in OBR causes a
reduction in H
2production and an upward trend in carbon
conversion ef ﬁciency. Moreover, OBR also does not favor syngas
yield in a CLG conversion. Interestingly to note that the reac-
tivity of gaseous fuels with iron-based oxygen carriers has the
following order: H 2>CO>CH4.
2. The gasi ﬁcation temperature is a key factor in the BCLG for iron-
based oxygen carriers. The increment of temperature signi ﬁ-
cantly enhances the gas yields and the process ef ﬁciencies. It is
found that the ilmenite shows a better performance at high
temperatures, while the iron ore performs greater results at
lower temperatures. However, the detailed evaluation of the
effect of gasi ﬁcation temperature on the BCLG process is limited
by the unavailability of the reaction mechanism of these types of
oxygen carriers at different temperatures. Therefore, further
studies on this topic would be necessary to clarify those phe-
nomena discussed in the previous section.

higher SBRs also enhance the syngas yield as well as the gas
yield and process ef ﬁciencies. Interestingly to note that the
carbon conversion ef ﬁciency obtained for the iron ore is higher
at lower SBRs, but the ilmenite shows better performance at a
higher amount of steam used in the gasi ﬁer. However, excess
steam may cause a decline in the BCLG performance due to heat
loss in the gasi ﬁer.

contact as well as heat and mass transfer in a bubbling ﬂuid-
ized bed reactor. In this study, the results show that there is a
minor variation in the fractions of gas species recorded, but the

the calcination temperature strongly in ﬂuences the reactivity of
ilmenite in the BCLG. Ilmenite performs low reactivity compared
to iron ore in this investigation. This is since the ilmenite was
oxidized in air at 850/C14C, whereas the iron ore was oxidized at

OCs prepared at 850 ℃ for 8 h (850NiES8, 850DS8) exhibited good characteristics in terms of pore structure. X- 
ray fluorescence (XRF), hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and thermo-gravimetric (TG) 
were employed to explore the elemental composition, reactivity, redox behavior and their effect on DS pyrolysis 
of the two selected OCs. The influence of mass ratio of 850NiES8, 850DS8 to DS (850NiES8/DS, 850DS8/DS) and

moted the gas yield of DS while accelerating the gasification process. It showed a better performance of 
850NiES8 than that of 850DS8 when it was below 900 ℃. On the other side, 850DS8 showed more advantage

1.Introduction 
As a novel technology, chemical looping gasification (CLG) provides 
oxygen for gasification from lattice oxygen in oxygen carrier (OC). CLG 
has many advantages compared with traditional gasification technology 
(Wang et al., 2020c; Zhang et al., 2021a, 2021b ). It saves the cost of 
gasification agent, and gains higher syngas calorific value. Besides, OC 
also acts as a catalyst (Sajjadi et al., 2021; Sampron et al., 2020 ) which 
can effectively reduce thermal NOx yield (P˘erez-Astray et al., 2019 ), in 
the condition that the fuel is not in direct contact with air and the 
operating temperature is relatively low. 
Excellent OC, which is cheap, has high redox activity, high me-
chanical strength and anti-sintering ability (Cheng et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019a ) is the key of CLG. OC is generally composed of active 
components and inert carriers. The active components are usually metal 
oxides such as Fe, Cu, Ni, Mn, Co and non-metal oxides like CaSO 4 (Liu 
et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020",317,"[ 0.00867316  0.00446282 -0.00856398 ...  0.00230647 -0.00941696

are joined much attention as OC because of their rich metal content, low 
cost and environmental friendliness (Sarafraz & Christo, 2020; Wang 
et al., 2021a, 2021b, 2021c; Yang et al., 2021 ). For example, Zhang et al. 
(2019) combined natural iron ore with biomass ash to prepare OC for 
chemical looping combustion (CLC). Similarly, Cuadrat et al. (2012) 
found that ilmenite could be used as a low cost and promising material 
for OC in CLC. In another work, Yang et al. (2017) prepared OC from 
phosphogypsum (PG) for lignite CLG and found CaSO 4 was almost 
converted to CaS over 850 ℃. Di et al. (2018) first explored the use of

195steel slag (a typical metallurgical waste) as OC and found the optimized 
reduction temperature for it was 750 •C. 
Electroplating sludge (ES) is a kind of solid waste produced by 
adding alkaline substances and flocculants (aluminum sulfate, ferric 
sulfate, ferric chloride, etc.) to metal electroplating and circuit board 
etching wastewater. With large amount and unstable state, ES is 
extremely harmful to the environment (Chen et al., 2021 ). There are 
about 15,000 electroplating enterprises in China with a production ca-
pacity of 300 million m2 electroplating area. And electroplating waste -
water which is about 4 billion m3 is discharged every year, producing 
around 10 million tons ES (Zhang et al., 2020a ). Traditional treatments 
of ES mainly include solidification and heat treatment for volume 
reduction. Resource-based treatments such as roasting leaching, bio-
logical recovery of heavy metals and hydrometallurgy have been studied 
recently. Wang et al. (2018) proposed a centrifuge electrode for high- 
purity Cu powders recovery by one-step electrodeposition from ES 
leaching solution. In another work, Tian et al. (2019) proposed a low- 
carbon redox refining process for valuable metals recovery in ES. The 
ratios of Pb, Sn, Zn removal reached 90.77%, 95.14%, 99.92% within 
60 min, respectively. However, the process of extracting metal from ES 
is complex and it is difficult to achieve resource recovery. It is known 
that electroplating wastewater contains a large amount of metal ions 
(Zhou et al., 2019 ) .The common flocculants, such as iron sulfate, ferric 
chloride, are rich in Fe. It is possible to prepare OC from ES, for nickel- 
containing electroplating sludge (NiES) is rich in Ni element and has the 
second large production among ES. However, there is no research on 
preparing OC by NiES so far. 
Dyeing sludge (DS) is a kind of residual waste produced from dyeing 
wastewater",497,[0.03478184 0.01747913 0.03246304 ... 0.03107681 0.02051624 0.02696852]
E:\\PINNs-Research\\Searched Articles\\Chemical looping gasification using Nickel-containing electroplating sludge.pdf,2,2,"treatment. The main components of DS are organic matter, 
dyes, auxiliaries, heavy metals. With the development of printing and 
dyeing industry, DS production continues increasing, of which improper 
treatment may lead to serious environment problem. Higher volatile 
content than most sludge and lower price than most biomass make DS a 
promising gasification raw material. However, there is still little 
research on DS CLG until now. Chen et al. (2016) investigated sludge 
gasification in fluidized bed using hematite as OC which improved 
carbon conversion (ηC) to 78.57%. In another work, Deng et al. (2019) 
investigated sludge gasification carried out in fixed bed using copper 
slag calcined at 1100 •C as OC, which increased ηC to 70.20% with valid 
gas yield of 0.23 Nm3/kg. The reduction and energy recovery of DS still 
need further study. CLG of DS can be an effective way for its resource 
utilization. Meanwhile, DS can also prepare OC because of its high metal 
content like Fe (Ksepko, 2013 ). 
Thus, the object of this work is to find cheap and good-performing 
OCs for CLG, study harmless NiES recycle treatment and realize the 
reduction and energy recovery of DS. In this work, NiES and DS were 
used to prepare low-cost OCs for the first time. The composition, 
structure, reactivity and cycle stability of the selected OCs were inves -
tigated. Then, DS CLG was conducted in a fixed bed reactor, where the 
effects of mass ratio of OC to DS and reaction temperature were 
investigated. 
2.Experimental section 
2.1. Materials 
Raw DS collected from Foshan Datang sewage treatment plant was 
dried in 105 •C oven until the mass was constant and then sieved to 90 
mesh. The lower calorific value of DS is 8.52 MJ/kg. The proximate and 
ultimate analyses are shown in Table 1. Same analyses of other two 
kinds of sewage sludge (SS) collected from Huizhou (SS1) and Foshan 
(SS2) sewage treatment plants were also conducted for comparison. It

that of other two kinds of sludge, which means DS can produce more 
combustible gas. Therefore, DS is a suitable gasification raw material. 
Raw NiES collected from an electroplating plant in Guangzhou was dried in 105 •C oven until the mass was constant and then sieved to 70 
mesh. NiES and DS were calcined in a tubular furnace in air atmosphere 
(250 mL/min) at 700, 850 and 900 •C for 3 h, respectively to obtain OCs 
700NiES3, 850NiES3, 900NiES3, 700DS3, 850DS3, 900DS3. NiES and 
DS were calcined in a tubular furnace in air atmosphere (250 mL/min) at 
850 •C for 5 h and 8 h, respectively to obtain OCs 850NiES5, 850NiES8, 
850DS5, 850DS8. 
2.2. Material characterization 
The crystal structure of NiES, DS and OCs were analyzed by an X-ray 
diffraction (XRD, X’Pert Pro MPD) using Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 40 mA), 
and the diffraction angle (2θ) of the samples was scanned at a scanning 
rate of 2•/min from 5•to 80•. Pore structures of the samples were 
measured by N2 physisorption at  196 •C using a Micromeritics ASAP 
2010 instruments. Optimal OC preparation condition was determined 
after crystal and pore structure analyses. 
After that, the elemental composition of NiES, DS and the selected 
OCs were analyzed by wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence spec-
trometer (XRF, AXIOSmAX-PETRO). Hydrogen-temperature pro-
grammed reduction (H2-TPR, chemstrat) was used to investigate the 
reactivity of the selected OCs. 0.1 g sample was heated in the adsorption 
instrument from 30 to 200 •C at 10 •C/min, and then cooled to 50 •C in 
Ar atmosphere (50 mL/min) to remove moisture in sample. After that 
the sample was heated to 1000 •C at 10 •C/min in 10% H2 atmosphere 
(Ar balance, 50 mL/min). A thermo-gravimetric analyzer (TG, NETSCH 
STA409C) was used to analyze the redox behaviors of the selected OCs. 
In the experiment, 10 mg sample was heated from 30 to 850 •C at 10 •C/",581,"[ 3.0293595e-02 -5.8386056e-03  7.6327115e-06 ...  2.0481752e-02

balance, 45 mL/min) was introduced to the reaction system for 30 min. 
In the oxidation stage, dry air (45 mL/min) was introduced for 15 min. 
N2 (55 mL/min) was introduced for 5 min before and after each 
reduction stage to avoid mixing H2 and air. 10 redox cycles have been 
carried out. The effect of the selected OCs on DS pyrolysis was analyzed 
by rapid heating TG analyzer (NETSCH SDT650). The test samples are 
DS, OCs, mixture of DS and OCs, mixture of DS and Al2O3. 5 mg sample 
was heated from 30 to 900 •C at the rate of 10 •C/min with high purity 
N2 as protective gas (30 mL/min). 
2.3. Fixed –bed setup and procedure 
CLG experiment of DS was conducted in a fixed bed reactor, and 
experimental device is shown in Fig. 1. The quartz tube is 800 mm in 
length, 17 mm in inner diameter and 23 mm in outer diameter. The 
quartz basket is 50 mm in length, 13 mm in inner diameter and 15 mm in 
outer diameter, with several holes distributed at the bottom. Before the 
experiment, the basket was placed at the top of the quartz tube, and 0.5 g 
quartz cotton was padded at the bottom of the basket. DS and OC were 
evenly mixed (mass of DS was 0.45 g) and put into basket. During the 
experiment, the flow rate of N2 introduced into the reactor was 100 mL/ 
min while device was heated from 30 •C to the reaction temperature, 
then switched to 20 mL/min. After 5 min of stabilization, the basket was 
put down to the middle of heating section, and gas collection bag was 
used to collect gas for 40 min (every 20 min). The gas composition was 
analyzed by gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890). Table 1

3.1.2. Pore structure analysis 
The pore structures of NiES and DS ash OCs are shown in Table 2. 
Specific surface area, total pore volume and average pore diameter of 
the samples decreased gradually as temperature rises under same 
calcination time. The specific surface areas of NiES and DS ash OCs 
decreased from 15.73, 1.39 m2/g at 700 •C to 7.72, 0.51 m2/g at 900 •C, 
respectively. When calcination temperature reached 850 •C, the specific 
surface areas of NiES and DS ash OCs increased from 8.62, 0.87 m2/g at 
3 h to 10.63, 1.34 m2/g at 8 h, respectively. It is known to us that the 
main reason affecting OC’s performance is the sintering under high 
temperature working condition, which leads to the densification of OC. 
The porous structure with large specific surface area is conducive to the 
full contact between OC and syngas, and also makes OC more efficient in 
catalyzing tar cracking. Stable crystal structure has not been formed at 
700 •C, higher calcination time enhances the mechanical strength of OC 
but also expends more energy. Therefore, 850 •C and 8 h is the suitable 
preparation condition. The specific surface areas of 850NiES8 and 
850DS8 are higher than most of the OCs that have been studied 
(850NiES8, especially) (Cao et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2019 ). 
3.1.3. Elemental composition analysis 
After calcination, the residues ’ mass fraction of 850NiES8, 850DS8 
are 73.4%, 52.87%, respectively. As shown in Table 3, the mass fraction 
of metal elements increases significantly. Fe, Ni and Ca basically 
remained in 850NiES8. While Fe is the main element of 850DS8 and 
some of it has been lost after calcination. According to XRD patterns, 
Fe2O3, NiO, NiFe 2O4 and a small amount of CaSO 4 are the active com-
ponents of 850NiES8 and Fe2O3 is the effective component of 8",528,"[ 0.01621882 -0.00129295  0.02236771 ...  0.02675978 -0.00528639

Previous studies have shown that NiO has high reactivity but poor 
stability with high price (Zheng et al., 2020 ). CaSO 4 which has high 
oxygen loading but poor reactivity and stability, is easy to obtain. Iron 
based OC is considered as the most promising OC candidate because it is 
stable, cheap, non-toxic and environmental friendly (Huang et al., 
2016 ). However, pure iron oxide often loses some oxygen carrying ca-
pacity during redox cycles due to its thermal sintering (Ma et al., 2020 ). 
Therefore, the preparation of composite OC has always drawn more 
attentions because the active components can make up for each other ’s 
defects and fully utilize. Huang et al. (2019) prepared NiFe 2O4 for 
chemical looping steam reforming and found it has stronger oxidation 
performance than Fe2O3. Yang et al. (2019b) prepared Fe/phospho -
gypsum composite OC which had better reactivity and recyclability 
compared with phosphogypsum. The reactivity of NiFe 2O4 was between 
NiO and Fe2O3, and NiO had no sintering phenomenon which could 
reduce CLG reaction temperature. 
3.1.4. H2 -TPR analysis 
The TPR profiles of 850NiES8 and 850DS8 are shown in Fig. R3. The reduction peak of 850NiES8 is observed around 679 •C, of which there is 
no obvious side peak. 850NiES8 is completely reduced below 900 •C. 
Previous studies have shown that the reduction peak of CaSO 4 appears 
near 950 •C (corresponding reaction: CaSO 4 → CaS), the peaks of Fe2O3 
appear at about 420 •C, 630 •C, 800 •C (corresponding reaction: Fe2O3 
→ Fe3O4, Fe3O4 → FeO, FeO → Fe) (Zhang et al., 2020b ), and the peak of 
NiO appears at about 360 •C (corresponding reaction: NiO → Ni) 
(Silvester et al., 2016 ). The oxides are continuously reduced at 
400–900 •C which suggests the obviously interaction among CaSO 4, 
Fe2O3 and NiO of 850NiES8. Consequently, the above results show tha",533,"[ 0.01328169 -0.01509893  0.00073711 ...  0.02106288  0.00378388

850NiES8 exhibits satisfactory reaction activity. 
As Fig. R3 shows, the main reduction peak of 850DS8 is observed 
around 780 •C and the two side peaks appear at 628 •C and 856 •C. It is 
obviously that peaks of 850DS8 are weaker than that of 850NiES8. Since 
oxidizability of the samples is mirrored by H2 reduction area, a larger 
area implies a higher reactivity, and 850NiES8 presents better reactivity 
than 850DS8. 
3.1.5. The redox behaviors of OCs evaluated by TGA 
Fig. R4 depicts the weight loss curves of 850NiES8 and 850DS8 
during 10 redox cycles. The mass reduction before the first cycle may be 
due to the evaporation of water in the sample. It can be seen from 
Fig. R4, the weight variation of 850NiES8 between reduced and oxidized 
state evidently increases in the second cycle. The average Ro of 
850NiES8 is about 18.46% in first 5 cycles, about 17.76% in last 5 cycles 
and about 18.11% in whole 10 cycles, respectively. Fig. R5 shows that 
the average Ro of 850DS8 is about 17.15% in first 5 cycles, 15.98% in 
last 5 cycles and 16.62% in whole 10 cycles, respectively. The redox 
cycles are stable after 3 cycles and the sintering of 850DS8 is more 
obvious than 850NiES8. 
It can be seen that the two OCs both need an activation process to 
possess stable redox reactivity. In this activation process, reactions be-
tween OC and gas result in many air passages in OC, which makes lattice 
oxygen develop further and the reduction is carried out more thoroughly 
as every redox conducted. The specific surface area of OC will slightly 
increase. This process of 850NiES8 is shorter than 850DS8. The Ro of 
850DS8 is a little lower than 850NiES8 in each cycle. The oxidation 
reaction of two OCs proceeds faster than their reduction reaction. 
Generally, 850NiES8 and 850DS8 maintain a high Ro which suggests 
that they can provide sufficient ox",514,"[ 0.041021   -0.00484874 -0.01858368 ...  0.02042176  0.00405646

3.1.6. The effect on DS pyrolysis of OCs evaluated by TGA 
DS850NiES8, DS850DS8 and DSAl 2O3 were prepared by mixing DS 
with 850NiES8, 850DS8 and Al2O3 at a mass ratio of 1:1. The TG 
experiment results are shown in Fig. R5. As Fig. R5(a) shown, there is 
almost no weight loss of 850NiES8 and 850DS8 in N2 atmosphere, and 
their TG curves nearly coincide. When temperature reaches 900 •C, the 
weight losses are 55.07% of DS, 30.66% of DSAl 2O3, 39.29% of 
DS850NiES8 and 36.91% of DS850DS8. OCs can obviously promote DS’s 
pyrolysis above 635 ℃. 
As Fig. R5(b) shows, the conversion of DS is divided into three stages: 
at the first stage (below 150 •C), the weight loss peak of DS is caused by 
the evaporation of water in sample; at the second stage (150 –500 •C), DS 
has weight loss peaks at 255 •C and 368 •C, respectively. That may be 
due to the cracking of volatile matter and the decomposition of lipids Table 2

198and carbohydrates (Wang et al., 2020a ); Specifically, at the third stage 
(500 –900 •C), DS has weight loss peaks at 708 •C and 830 •C, which can 
be due to the transformation of fixed carbon, decomposition and reac-
tion of inorganic matter in sludge (Lin et al., 2016 ). The weight loss 
peaks of DS850NiES8 and DS850DS8 at the third stage are 690 •C, 
725 •C and 680 •C, 770 •C, respectively. 
All the samples exhibit no obvious difference in the first two stages. 
But at the third stage, 850NiES8 and 850DS8 significantly promote DS’s 
pyrolysis by releasing lattice oxygen, where the second weight loss peak 
at this stage of DS850DS8 is obviously weaker than DS850NiES8, which 
means 850NiES8 can offer more oxygen and exhibits better reactivity 
than 850DS8. At 900 •C, the mass loss rates of DS850NiES8 and 
DS850NiES8 are close to 0, which indicates the pyrolysis of DS has been 
completed, and the residual ash will not be further cracked or reacted. 
However, the mass loss rates of DS and DSAl 2O3 are still significantly 
less than 0 at 900 •C, which means the weight loss has n",322,"[ 0.05964907 -0.00442189  0.00941478 ...  0.02958551  0.02788581

3.2.1. Effect of oxygen addition 
The effect of mass ratio of 850NiES8, 850DS8 to DS (850NiES8/DS, 
850DS8/DS) on DS gasification was investigated. The results of 40-min 
sampling time are shown in Fig. 2. With the increase of 850NiES8/DS 
from 0 to 3, CH4 yield fluctuates in a certain range, H2 decreases grad-
ually, CO reaches its maximum at 850NiES8/DS of 0.5, Vg reaches its 
maximum (0.223 Nm3/kg) at 850NiES8/DS of 0.5, and CO2 yield 
gradually increases. When 850NiES8/DS increases to 1, ηC and Gv reach 
their maximum (80.94%, 0.373 Nm3/kg). When 850DS8 is introduced 
to the reaction, Yi basically shows same trend, ηC and Gv reach their 
maximum (76.37%, 0.354 Nm3/kg) at 850DS8/DS of 1 while Vg grad-
ually decreases. 
On the one hand, OC can provide lattice oxygen so that combustible 
gas will react with OC to generate CO2 and H2O, which explains the 
downtrend of Vg and the uptrend of CO2. On the other hand, OC promotes the decomposition of sludge and the secondary cracking of tar 
(tar → H2 CO CnHm). Furthermore, the carbon in sludge can react 
with OC to gen",367,"[ 0.01881694 -0.01660008  0.00244944 ...  0.00368487  0.00879488

is added to 0.5, and ηC, Gv significantly increase when 850NiES8/DS and 
850DS8/DS are added to 1. ηC and Gv begin to decrease when 850NiES8/ 
DS and 850DS8/DS exceed 1. This may because that excessive addition 
of OC may hinder the release of volatile matter, block mutual reactions, 
and slow down heat transfer from fixed bed to sludge. As shown in Fig. 3, 
the addition of the two OCs both significantly accelerates the gasifica -
tion of DS. When 850NiES8/DS and 850DS8/DS are 1, the conversion of 
carbon is basically completed within 20 min, and H2 in combustible gas 
is not completely released. Generally, a small amount of OC can 
significantly promote the conversion of DS and shorten the time 
required for fully gasification. Vg, ηC, Gv can reach their maximum when 
850NiES8/DS is 0.5, 1, and 1, respectively. The addition of 850NiES8 is 
more conducive to DS gasification than 850DS8.

fixed at 1. When 850NiES8/DS is 1, ηC gradually increases from 71.95% 
to 84.53%. H2 and CO yield gradually increase, CO2 yield reaches its 
maximum at 900 •C and CH4 yield fluctuates in a certain range. Vg and 
Gv gradually increase from 0.137, 0.311 Nm3/kg to 0.256, 0.425 Nm3/ 
kg, respectively. When 850DS8/DS is 1, Yi gradually increases. ηC in-

Nm3/kg to 0.267, 0.454 Nm3/kg, respectively. 
High temperature is conducive to the decomposition of DS and the 
secondary cracking of tar (tar → H2 CO CnHm), resulting in more 
volatiles. Therefore, ηC, Vg and Gv both show apparent uptrend. 
Furthermore, as temperature rises, the gasification of carbon (C H2O 
→ H2 CO, C CO2 → 2CO) which is an endothermic reaction will be 
promoted. While the reaction between CO, H2 with OC to produce CO2, 
H2O which is an exothermic reaction will be inhibited. Thus, more CO,

reactor experiments, respectively. Compared with Co3O4, CoFe 2O4 in solid-solid reaction reveals that CO is a 
dominant gas, and it shows higher CO gas yield due to Co3Fe7 formatted. In gas-solid reaction, the result reveals 
that H2 is a dominant gas, and it shows the highest H2 gas yield at 850 •C and 80 μL/min (steam flow) since 
(Co0.62Fe1.38)FeO 4 structure assist the mobility of lattice oxygen. Between solid-solid and gas-solid reactions, 
CoFe 2O4 displays different characteristic as follows: 1) it shows compact surface in solid-solid step, while it keeps 
a porous structure in gas-solid step; 2) Co exhibits a higher oxidizing role in the gas-solid step than in the solid- 
solid step. After different steam flows (60–100 μL/min), the maximum H2 gas yield is 1.16 Nm3/kg at 80 μL/min 
with CoFe 2O4. However, the formation of Fe3C hinders H₂ gas production at steam flow rates exceeding 80 μL/ 
min. In the chemical looping process, CoFe 2O4 exhibits relative stability after three cycles.

production of hydrogen via biomass gasification is regarded as one of 
the most promising technologies for biomass utilization. This is attrib -
uted to the fact that biomass is the fourth-largest energy resource, 
characterized by abundant reserves and several advantages, including 
carbon neutrality and diversity [3,4] . In traditional biomass gasification 
processes, air, oxygen, steam, or carbon dioxide are typically employed 
as gasification agents. However, these agents are associated with several 
drawbacks, including the formation of undesired CO₂ and tar, nitrogen 
dilution, and the high cost of oxygen agents. Consequently, a promising 
alternative approach known as biomass chemical-looping gasification 
has been proposed. In this process, an oxygen carrier circulates between 
the fuel reactor, steam reactor, and air reactor to supply oxygen (in the form of lattice oxygen) for the gasification of biomass. In the fuel 
reactor, the oxygen carrier (MeO x) is reduced by biomass, producing 
H2O and CO2, a stage referred to as the oxygen reduction stage (MeO y). 
In the steam reactor, hydrogen is generated through steam splitting over 
the reduced oxygen carrie",256,[0.01242637 0.0346482  0.02677895 ... 0.00900266 0.0017515  0.01502205]

In the air reactor, the oxygen carrier (MeO yδ) is regenerated to its 
original form (MeO x) for the subsequent cycle [5–7].
The primary advantage of biomass chemical-looping gasification is 
the production of high-quality hydrogen-rich syngas through the utili-
zation of an oxygen carrier, thereby circumventing the need for 
expensive pure oxygen. Additionally, the oxygen carrier can function as 
an in-situ catalyst for tar cracking [8,9] . In summary, the utilization of 
biomass via chemical-looping gasification represents an attractive 
technological approach. The reactions occurring in the fuel reactor 
during biomass chemical-looping gasification are highly complex. Py-
rolysis and gasification constitute the primary steps in biomass con-
version. In the pyrolysis step, the products, such as volatiles, tar, and

2biochar, can be either completely oxidized or partially oxidized by the 
oxygen carrier [10]. The degree of oxidation is contingent upon the 
quantity and properties of the oxygen carrier. Concurrently, the oxygen 
carrier can catalyze the reforming of tar, thereby enhancing the pro-
duction of hydrogen-rich syngas. In the gasification step, biochar is 
oxidized by either the oxygen carrier or a gasification medium, such as 
H2O or CO2 [11]. However, the advancement of biomass 
chemical-looping gasification technology confronts two significant 
challenges, which are elaborated below.
The first key challenge in biomass chemical-looping gasification 
technology is the selection of an appropriate oxygen carrier, which must 
possess adequate reactivity and stability. During the reaction process, 
the oxygen carrier may undergo sintering, coke deposition, and other 
undesirable phenomena, which can significantly reduce its operational 
lifetime. Transition metals are the primary oxygen carriers and have 
been extensively investigated, including oxides of Cu [12,13] , Ni [14, 
15], Co [16,17] , Fe [18,19] and Mn [20,21] . Compared with other metal 
oxides, Fe-based oxygen carriers are considered the most suitable for 
hydrogen generation due to several advantages: superior water-splitting 
performance, favorable thermodynamic properties, low cost, high me-
chanical strength, and environmental benignity [22]. Hu et al. [23]
reported that Fe2O3/Al2O3, as an oxygen carrier, has been investigated 
for hydrogen-rich syngas production. The results indicate that the 
optimal conditions for hydrogen-rich gas yield are achieved at 900 •C 
with a steam-to-biomass (S/B) ratio of 2.8. However, Fe-based oxygen 
carriers generally exhibit low oxygen transport capacity. To address this 
limitation, several scholars have explored bimetallic oxygen carriers due 
to the drawbacks associated with single-metallic oxygen carriers. In a 
previous study [24], CaFe 2O4 was investigated as an oxygen carrier for 
hydrogen-rich syngas production and demonstrated hi",477,"[ 0.01864983 -0.00048051  0.01612533 ... -0.00966916 -0.01201247

Chen et al. [25] reported on the reactivity of pyrolyzed gas and biochar 
converted to hydrogen-rich syngas using MFe 2O4(where M Cu, Ba, Ni, 
and Co) as an oxygen carrier. The results indicated that CoFe 2O4 ach-
ieved the highest hydrogen production and excellent conversion selec-
tivity. The synergistic effect between Co and Fe significantly enhanced 
the reactivity. The same findings were reported by Li et al. [26], who 
investigated that the hydrogen yield over CoFe 2O4 is 1.7 times higher 
than that of Fe2O3. The results indicated that the increase in hydrogen 
yield is attributed to the synergistic effect between Co and Fe, a high 
degree of reduction, and reversible phase changes. Wei et al. [27] re-
ported that compared with Fe2O3, the formation of Co-Fe metal oxide 
increases the concentration of oxygen vacancies, thereby promoting the 
mobility of lattice oxygen and improving conversion efficiency. There -
fore, the CoFe 2O4 oxygen carrier is deemed suitable for hydrogen-rich 
syngas production via biomass chemical-looping gasification.
The second major challenge in biomass chemical-looping gasifica -
tion is the relatively low hydrogen content in syngas. Although the 
volatile fraction of biomass is characterized by a high hydrogen content, 
the contribution of biochar gasification to hydrogen production should 
not be overlooked [28]. In addition, the reactivity of biochar gasification 
is lower than that of volatile gases, which necessitates higher reaction 
temperatures. Gao et al. [29] investigated methane (CH 4) as a volatile 
gas using a modified CoFe 2O4 oxygen carrier in chemical-looping 
hydrogen production. The results showed that the CH4 conversion effi-
ciency reached 85.97 % at 800 •C. In contrast, the conversion efficiency 
between CoFe 2O4 and biochar was reported to be 39 % at 1000 •C by 
Chen et al. [25]. To enhance the hydrogen content, improving the 
reactivity between CoFe 2O4 and biochar is of critical importance. In the 
biochar gasification process utilizing CoFe 2O4 as the oxygen carrier, 
both solid-solid reactions (between biochar and the Co",512,"[ 0.03544436  0.00510978 -0.01083398 ...  0.01827459 -0.02203999

carrier) and gas-solid reactions (between gaseous species and the 
CoFe 2O4 oxygen carrier) occur. The reaction behavior exhibited by 
CoFe 2O4 when used as an oxygen carrier for hydrogen production is 
distinct. Therefore, both the solid-solid reaction and the gas-solid reac-
tion should be considered simultaneously to improve hydrogen pro-
duction. Chen et al. [25] reported that the structure and surface valence of the CoFe 2O4 oxygen carrier affect the gas composition in both 
solid-solid and gas-solid reactions. Li et al. [30] reported on a solid-solid 
reaction involving a CuFe 2O4 oxygen carrier. The results indicated that 
CuFe 2O4 exhibits a lower decomposition temperature, better thermo -
dynamic capability, and higher oxygen deficiency. Huang et al. [31]
reported on the use of biochar with a NiFe 2O4 oxygen carrier for 
hydrogen-rich syngas production in gas-solid reactions. The results 
showed that a suitable steam content of 56.33 % was determined, 
achieving a maximum carbon conversion rate of 88.12 % and a syngas 
yield of 2.58 L/g char.
Based on the aforementioned studies, the behavior of the oxygen 
carrier in solid-solid and gas-solid reactions exhibits significant differ -
ences, such as variations in gas composition and structural changes. 
These differences are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the 
chemical looping gasification process. Both solid-solid and gas-solid 
reactions should be considered concurrently in the study of chemical 
looping gasification. However, there is limited research on the reaction 
behavior between CoFe 2O4 and biochar in both solid-solid and gas-solid 
reactions. Therefore, in this study, the reaction behaviors of Co3O4 and 
CoFe 2O4 oxygen carriers are compared simultaneously in solid-solid and 
gas-solid reactions. The analysis includes the synergistic effects of Co 
and Fe, as well as the characteristics of the chemical looping process. In 
different reaction temperatures and steam flows, a series of character -
ization methods, such as XRD, SEM, XPS, etc., are employed to inves -
tigate the effects of structural chan",475,"[ 0.027439   -0.02258335 -0.0087207  ...  0.02106024  0.00305196

examined within the chemical looping process. Ultimately, the optimal 
conditions for hydrogen-rich syngas production are determined.
2.Experiments
2.1. Synthesis of oxygen carrier
The Co3O4 and CoFe 2O4 oxygen carriers were synthesized via a sol- 
gel method similar to our previous work [32]. Briefly, Co(NO 3)2⋅6H₂O, 
Fe(NO 3)3⋅9H2O, and citric acid were used as synthetic reagents, with a 
molar ratio of metal ions to citric acid of 1:2. The mixture was stirred 
and dried to obtain the precursor of the Co3O4 and CoFe 2O4 oxygen 
carriers. The resultant precursor was calcined in air at a heating rate of 5 
•C/min, first at 500 •C for 1 h and subsequently at 850 •C for 3 h. Finally, 
the calcined oxygen carriers were crushed and sieved to obtain particles 
with a size range of 106–120 µm.
2.2. Preparation of biomass char
Straw sourced from Chengdu, China, was utilized as the biomass 
material. It was pyrolyzed at 800 •C under a nitrogen flow of 50 mL/min 
for 1 h, with a heating rate of 5 •C/min. The resultant biochar was 
subsequently crushed and sieved to obtain particles with a size range of 
106–120 µm. The ultimate and proximate analyses of the straw char 
were conducted in accordance with the American Society for Testing 
and Materials D1102-84(2007) standard, with the results presented in 
Table 1.
2.3. Characterization
The crystal phases of fresh and spent Co3O4 and CoFe 2O4 oxygen 
carriers were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD; X′ Pert Pro 
MPD) equipped with Cu Kα radiation. The XRD analysis was conducted 
at an operating voltage of 40 kV and a current of 40 mA, with a scanning 
range from 20•to 80•at a rate of 2•/min. Hydrogen temperature- 
programmed reduction (H₂-TPR) was performed using a TPDPO 1100 
Series apparatus with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The test 
was conducted with 50 mg of fresh Co3O4 or CoFe 2O4 oxygen carrier in a 
5 % H₂/N2 gas mixture (flow rate: 50 mL/min) at a heating rate of 10 •C/ 
min over a temperature range of 100–850 •C.C. Liu et al.",604,"[ 0.03002113 -0.01854583  0.01485039 ...  0.0135118  -0.02585661

3The specific surface areas and pore size distributions of the oxygen 
carriers were analyzed using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method 
with a TriStar II Series device. Nitrogen adsorption and desorption iso-
therms were measured at  196 •C. The surface morphology of both 
fresh and spent oxygen carriers (Co3O4 and CoFe 2O4) was examined 
using a high-resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM, Quanta 
200, FEI, Netherlands). The surface elemental compositions of the fresh 
and spent oxygen carriers (Co3O4 and CoFe 2O4) were characterized by 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD) using a 
monochromatized Al Kα X-ray source. The binding energies of the ele-
ments were referenced to the C 1s hydrocarbon peak at 284.8 eV.
2.4. Reactivity investigation
The reactivity of Co3O4 and CoFe 2O4 oxygen carriers with biochar 
was investigated in a fixed-bed system as illustrated in Fig. S1. The 
reactor consisted of a steel tube with a length of 400 mm and an inner 
diameter of 20 mm. A mixture of the oxygen carrier and biochar sample, 
supported on quartz wool, was loaded onto a porous plate positioned 
200 mm from the bottom of the reactor. The reactor was then heated to 
the target temperature, and the specified steam flow was introduced",334,[0.03222163 0.01066899 0.01141393 ... 0.01612344 0.01211468 0.01392651]

syngas production was maintained at 1 h. In the gas-solid reaction step, 
the ratio of straw char to oxygen carrier in the presence of steam (80 μL/ 
min) was maintained at 1:1 (0.2 g:0.2 g) within a temperature range of 
700–900 •C, with argon (60 mL/min) used as the carrier gas. Similar 
procedures were applied for the solid-solid reaction, with the exception 
of steam. For the CoFe 2O4 oxygen carrier, the influence of different 
steam flow rates (60–100μ L/min) was investigated at the optimal re-
action temperature. Finally, the chemical looping test was investigation 
at optimum conditions. The produced gases were detected using a 
thermal conductivity detector (TCD) coupled with an online gas chro-
matograph (Agilent 7890) after cooling and drying. The gases analyzed 
included H₂, CO, CO2, and CH4. A TDX-01 column was selected for the 
analysis of H2, CO, and CH4, while a Porapak Q column was used for CO2 
analysis.

The crystal phases of Co3O4 and CoFe 2O4 are presented in Fig. 1. The 
diffraction peaks at 2θ 30.12•, 35.49•, 37.16•, 43.14•, 53.61•, 57.00•, 
and 62.62•are respectively attributed to the reflections from the (220), 
(311), (222), (400), (422), (511), and (440) crystal planes of CoFe 2O4 
(PDF: 22-1086). For Co3O4 (PDF: 43-1003), the diffraction peaks at 2θ 
31.37•, 36.90•, 38.68•, 44.92•, 59.39•, and 65.31•correspond to the 
reflections from the (220), (311), (222), (400), (511), and (440) crystal 
planes, respectively. No additional phases, such as Fe2O3, were detected 
in either Co3O4 or CoFe 2O4. This indicates that Co3O4 and CoFe 2O4 were 
successfully synthesized.

carrier. The crystal sizes of Co3O4 and CoFe 2O4 were calculated using

the crystal sizes due to its highest intensity for both Co3O4 and CoFe 2O4 
oxygen carriers, and the results are presented in Table 2. The CoFe 2O4 
oxygen carrier (11.77 nm) exhibits a smaller crystal size compared to 
the Co3O4 oxygen carrier (16.02 nm). This indicates that the modifica -
tion of Co3O4 with Fe-doping can reduce the crystal size, thereby 
enhancing the anti-sintering ability. The lattice parameter (a) and unit 
cell volume (V) of Co3O4 and CoFe 2O4 were calculated using the 
following relationships (Eqs. (5) and (6)). The results shown in Table 2
indicate that Fe-doping alters the lattice parameter and unit cell volume 
of Co3O4. This change may be attributed to structural defects introduced 
by Fe-doping [34]. On the other hand, the position of the (311) lattice 
plane in the Co3O4 oxygen carrier is significantly shifted. This shift is 
attributed to the larger ionic radius of Fe3⁺(0.0550 nm) compared to 
Co3⁺(0.0545 nm). In our previous work [32], Fe2O3 was doped with Mn Table 1

3.2. H2-TPR analysis
H₂-TPR analysis was performed to elucidate the influence of Co-Fe 
interaction on the reducibility of the oxygen carriers. Fig. 2presents 
the reduction characteristics of Co3O4 and CoFe 2O4 oxygen carriers. As 
shown in Fig. 2(a), two distinct reduction peaks are observed for 
CoFe 2O4 at 435.9 •C and 779.6 •C. The first peak at approximately 435.9 
•C may be attributed to the partial reduction of CoFe 2O4 to metallic 
cobalt [35]. The second peak is associated with the sequential reduction 
of iron oxides, specifically the transformation from Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, then 
to FeO, and finally to metallic iron [36]. Therefore, the reduction pro-
cess of CoFe 2O4 likely proceeds via a stepwise pathway in the following 
sequence: CoFe 2O4 →Co Fe2O3 →Co Fe3O4 →Co FeO → Fe(Co) 
alloy. For the Co3O4 oxygen carrier, two peaks are observed as shown in 
Fig. 2(b). The first peak at 570.8 •C is attributed to the reduction of 
Co3O4 to CoO. As the reduction progresses further, another peak appears 
at 796.5 •C, corresponding to the reduction of CoO to Co. In comparison,

cating a smaller crystallite size. This observation is consistent with the 
XRD results. On the other hand, the results reveal that the reduction 
performance of the CoFe 2O4 oxygen carrier is significantly enhance 
[29].
3.3. BET and SEM analysis
The relative surface areas of the Co3O4 and CoFe 2O4 oxygen carriers 
are presented in Table 3. The results indicate that the surface area of the CoFe 2O4 oxygen carrier is not significantly improved compared to 
Co3O4. Based on the XRD results for fresh Co3O4 and CoFe 2O4 oxygen 
carriers, the crystallite size of CoFe 2O4 is smaller than that of Co3O4, 
which typically indicates a larger surface area. However, the experi -
mental results show the opposite trend, with CoFe 2O4 exhibiting a lower 
surface area than Co3O4. This discrepancy may be attributed to differ -
ences in particle morphology and pore distribution. The results of N2 
adsorption/desorption isotherms, as depicted in Fig. S2, reveal that both 
Co3O4 and CoFe 2O4 oxygen carriers exhibit a hysteresis loop within the 
relative pressure range of 0.95 –1.0, indicative of type III isotherms ac-
cording to the IUPAC classification [37]. The SEM analysis, also pre-
sented in Fig. S2, demonstrates that the surface of the Co3O4 oxygen 
carrier is relatively compact, whereas that of CoFe 2O4 appears more 
porous. Surface area is a critical factor influencing gas-solid reactions in",369,"[ 0.02610876 -0.01697069 -0.0020052  ...  0.03434125  0.01279564

enhanced compared to Co3O4, despite its smaller crystallite size. This 
discrepancy may be attributed to differences in particle morphology and 
pore distribution.
3.4. XPS analysis
The surface elemental compositions of Co3O4 and CoFe 2O4 were 
analyzed using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), with the results 
presented in Fig. 3. Fig. 3(a)–(c) display the valence states of Co 2p, O 1s, 
and Fe 2p for the CoFe 2O4 oxygen carrier. The Co 2p spectra (Fig. 3a) 
consist of two spin-orbit doublet characteristic peaks at 786.8 eV and 
802.7 eV, accompanied by a shake-up satellite peak. The coexistence of 
Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 indicates the presence of both Co2⁺ and Co3⁺ in 
the oxygen carrier. The peaks at binding energies of 779.7 eV (Co2⁺ 
bonded to oxygen atoms-Co2in the B site) and 781.5 eV correspond to 
Co atoms at the surface of the oxygen carrier (Co2⁺ in A-sites), namely 
the Co2⁺-OH and Co2-Co-OOC bonding configurations [38,39] . The 
peak at 795.7 eV was derived from Co 2p1/2, which was ascribed to 
Co3⁺ oxide species. The O 1s spectra could be deconvoluted into three 
spectral bands at 529.6 eV, 530.4 eV, and 531.7 eV, re",439,"[3.1476371e-02 1.5300297e-05 6.2022111e-03 ... 4.3280009e-02 1.4171435e-02

6The solid-solid reaction is an important process in chemical looping 
gasification due to the initial reaction between the oxygen carrier and 
biochar. As shown in Fig. 4(a)-(b), the gas yield results for CO using 
CoFe 2O4 indicate that CO has the highest yield among all gaseous 
products, increasing from 0.039 to 0.068 Nm³/kg with an increase in 
reaction temperature. Additionally, the gas yield of CO2 also increases 
from 0.036 to 0.052 Nm3/kg within the temperature range of 700–900 
•C. These results suggest that the oxidation of biochar is the dominant 
process in the solid-solid reaction, which is attributed to the reaction of 
lattice oxygen with carbon, as previously reported [44]. While the gas 
yield of H2 is relatively low, ranging from 0.006 to 0.025 Nm3/kg, its 
production can be attributed to the formation of volatiles, which in-
creases with rising temperature. Zheng et al. [45] and Sun et al. [46]
reported that biochar can further produce volatiles due to the breaking 
of C-C and C-H bonds as the temperature increases. Based on the gas 
yields, the LHV varies from 7.53 to 8.45 kJ/Nm3. Notably, the major gas 
yields, including CO and H2, show minimal increase after 850 •C.

4%). From the H2/CO ratio, which is below 1, it is evident that CO is the 
primary product in this step rather than H2. Compared with the 
CoFe 2O4oxygen carrier, the Co3O4 oxygen carrier exhibits a similar 
trend. As shown in Fig. 4(c)-(d), the gas yield of CO is the predominant 
product, increasing with the reaction temperature, ranging from 0.036 
to 0.062 Nm3/kg. Concurrently, the gas yield of CO2 also increases, 
while the gas yield of H2 remains relatively low, increasing from 0.0025 
to 0.023 Nm3/kg with rising reaction temperature. This indicates that 
CO is the primary product in the solid-solid reaction when using the 
Co3O4 oxygen carrier. The ratio of H2/CO is blow 1, which is also 
indicated this result. Based on the gas yield, the LHV value is various 
from 8.14 to 8.49kJ/Nm3. The major gas yield, such as CO and H2 also 
shows little increase after 850 •C. However, the gas yield for the all the 
gas with Co3O4 oxygen carrier is less than CoFe 2O4 oxygen carrier, and 
its result could be illustrated by XRD.

detected in the spent samples. Specifically, the CoO phase was identified 
at 700 •C and 750 •C, while the Co phase was detected at temperatures 
above 800 •C. These results indicate that carbon was oxidized through a 
series of oxygen release steps, progressing from Co3O4 to CoO and then 
to Co. This sequence is consistent with the observed significant increase 
in the gas yields of CO and CO2 before 800 •C.With increasing temper -
ature, the crystallite size of Co decreased from 8.6nm to 5.8nm, as 
calculated using the Scherrer formula and presented in Table S1. The 
reduction in particle size is advantageous for enhancing reaction activ-
ity, thereby resulting in an increased gas yield. For the CoFe 2O4 oxygen 
carrier, the phases Fe3O4, CoO, and Co3Fe7 were detected in the spent 
samples. Specifically, the Fe3O4 and CoO phases were identified at 700 
•C and 750 •C, while Co3Fe7 was detected at temperatures above 800 •C. 
The formation of the Fe3O4 phase enhances carbon oxidation, leading to 
an increased gas yield of CO and CO2. This indicates that CoFe 2O4 
possesses an enhanced oxygen storage capacity. With increasing tem-
perature, the Co3Fe7 alloy phase was detected, which is considered a 
highly effective oxidizing material. Meng et al.",323,"[ 0.05990791 -0.04030341 -0.03257106 ...  0.00769072  0.03309448

an electrocatalyst material for the oxygen evolution reaction, with its 
oxidizing characteristics demonstrated through the oxidation state 
change from Co2⁺ to Co3⁺. This suggests that carbon could be further 
oxidized in the presence of Co3Fe7. On the other hand, the crystallite size 
of Co3Fe7 decreased to 6.8nm at 850 •C, while it increased to 8.1nm at 
900 •C, as shown in Table S1. This result indicates that the enhancement 
of crystallite size could lead to a decrease in oxidation reactivity. 
Therefore, the optimal temperature for the solid-solid reaction, consid -

indicates that Co plays a more significant oxidizing role in the gas-solid 
step compared to the solid-solid step. Conversely, the ratio of Fe2⁺/ 
Fe3⁺decreased in both solid-solid and gas-solid reactions, suggesting a 
consistent reduction trend for Fe across both reaction types. In the 
chemical looping process, the interaction of char with H2O and reduced 
Fe participates in the reactions as detailed in Table S3. Specifically, the 
reaction of a reduced state oxygen carrier (Fe/FeO) with H2O corre -
sponds to reactions R1-R3, while the reaction of biochar with an 
oxidized state oxygen carrier (Fe3O4) is represented by reactions R4-R6. 
Additionally, the interaction of char and H2O is described by reactions 
R7-R9.
3.6. The effect of different steam flow rates
Based on the above study and discussion, a reaction temperature of 
850 •C was found to be optimal for maximizing H2 gas yield using the 
CoFe 2O4 oxygen carrier. Consequently, the effect of different steam flow rates on H₂ production at 850 •C was investigated for both CoFe 2O4 and 
Co3O4 oxygen carriers. For the CoFe 2O4 oxygen carrier, as shown in 
Fig.",304,"[ 0.01600704 -0.02618101 -0.01165485 ...  0.00413741  0.00162218

H₂ gas yield. However, the H2 gas yield exhibited a slight decrease when 
the steam flow rate exceeded 80 μL/min (1.16 Nm³/kg). Additionally, 
the H2/CO ratio reached its highest value (3.36) at a steam flow rate of 
80 μL/min. Excessive steam flow could carry away significant amounts 
of heat, thereby reducing the activity of the WGS reaction [51]. Based on 
the gas yield, the LHV value is various from 8.32 to 8.48 kJ/Nm3. On the 
other hand, carbon conversion exhibits a similar trend, with increasing 
steam flow being beneficial for enhancing carbon conversion [9]. 
Compared with the CoFe 2O4 oxygen carrier, the Co3O4 oxygen carrier 
shows a similar trend in H2 gas yield, as depicted in Fig. 9(c)-(d), with 
the highest yield (0.69 Nm3/kg) achieved at a steam flow rate of 80 
μL/min. However, the increase in H2 gas yield across all steam flow rates 
studied is lower than that observed with the CoFe 2O4 oxygen carrier. 
Additionally, carbon conversion decreases at steam flow rates above 80 
μL/min. These results indicate that a steam flow rate of 80 μL/min is 
optimal for the CoFe 2O4 oxygen carrier, yielding the highest H₂ gas",321,"[ 0.01579739 -0.01065432  0.01824811 ... -0.00321298  0.00556591

However, Huang et al. [31] reported that H₂ yield increases with 
increasing steam flow (0–0.1 mL/min) when using NiFe 2O4 as the oxy-
gen carrier at 850 •C. The differing trends in H2 gas yield are attributed 
to the differences in the electronic structures of CoFe 2O4 and NiFe 2O4.
The results can be elucidated by the XRD analysis of the spent 
samples, as shown in Fig. 10(a)-(b). For the spent Co3O4oxygen carrier, 
the main phase is metallic Co at steam flow rates of 60–80 μL/min, while 
the CoO phase is present at steam flow rates exceeding 80 μL/min. This 
indicates that the reduction ability of Co is higher than that of CoO, 
which correlates with the higher H2 gas yield observed at 80 μL/min. For 
the spent CoFe 2O4 oxygen carrier, the main phase is (Co0.62Fe1.38)FeO 4 
across the tested steam flow rates of 60–100 μL/min. Notably, the Fe3C 
phase is only detected at a steam flow rate of 100 μL/min. This phase 
likely originates from the reaction of Fe2O3 with char (3Fe 2O3 8C →

water gas shift reaction (CO 2 H2 → CO H2O), as reported in previous 
studies [52], which may inhibit H2 production.
3.7. Chemical looping test
The chemical looping test conducted under optimal conditions (850 
•C and 80 µL/min) is illustrated in Fig. 11(a)-(b). The gas yield of H₂ 
exhibited a minimal decrease, from 1.16 Nm3/kg to 1.01 Nm3/kg, while 
the gas yield of CO2 also decreased slightly, from 0.515 Nm3/kg to 0.491 
Nm3/kg. Conversely, the gas yield of CO increased marginally, from 
0.345 Nm3/kg to 0.357 Nm3/kg, thereby reducing the H2/CO ratio. 
Additionally, both carbon conversion and lower heating value (LHV) 
were relatively stable. In the chemical looping process, the CoFe 2O4 
oxygen carrier maintained its spinel structure after three cycles, as 
shown in Fig. 12(a)-(b). This indicates that CoFe 2O4 demonstrated sta-
bility during the chemical loopin",290,"[ 0.01751012 -0.00914131 -0.00833815 ... -0.01779215 -0.01089478

was detected after the second and third cycles, rather than the CoO 
phase observed after the first cycle. This difference could inhibit deep 
oxidation of CO gas to CO2,
4.Conclusion
The CoFe 2O4 and Co3O4 oxygen carriers were compared with bio-
char in both solid-solid and gas-solid reactions for hydrogen production. 
The oxygen carriers were synthesized via the sol-gel method, and a 
comprehensive suite of characterization techniques was employed to 
analyze the properties of fresh and spent CoFe 2O4 and Co3O4 oxygen 
carriers, including XRD, SEM, XPS, BET, H2-TPR, and others. Compared 
with the Co3O4 oxygen carrier, CoFe 2O4 exhibited a smaller lattice size and lower reduction temperature, as well as a higher content of lattice 
oxygen. These properties contribute to enhanced hydrogen production 
for the CoFe 2O4 oxygen carrier. The smaller lattice size and higher lat-
tice oxygen content of CoFe 2O4 facilitate more efficient oxygen transfer 
and utilization",240,"[ 0.04580754 -0.02551487 -0.01478432 ...  0.0199946  -0.00010228

hydrogen generation.
For the CoFe 2O4 and Co3O4 oxygen carriers at temperatures ranging 
from 700 •C to 900 •C, CO gas is the major component in the solid-solid 
reaction, while the CoFe 2O4 oxygen carrier exhibits higher carbon 
conversion and gas yield. The differing results are attributed to the 
formation of spent phases during the solid-solid step, specifically Co3O4 
→ CoO → Co and CoFe 2O4 → Fe3O4 CoO → Co3Fe7. The activity of the 
Co3Fe7 phase facilitates the conversion of biochar to CO gas at 850 •C.In 
the gas-solid step, H₂ gas is the primary gas component, and the H2 gas 
yield (0.97 Nm3/kg) is notably high at 850 •C due to the formation of the 
(Co0.62Fe1.38)FeO 4 phase. Additionally, the characterization results of 
spent CoFe 2O4 samples at 850 •C are as follows: (1) The surface is 
compact in the solid-solid step, while it retains a porous structure in the 
gas-solid step; (2) Co plays a more significant oxidizing role in the g",278,"[ 0.03015183 -0.02411235 -0.01340082 ...  0.01644335  0.00597111

solid step than in the solid-solid step.
Furthermore, the effects of different steam flow rates (60–100 μL/ 
min) on hydrogen production using CoFe 2O4 and Co3O4 oxygen carriers 
were investigated in the gas-solid reaction. The results indicate that the 
maximum H2 gas yield is 1.16 Nm3/kg at a steam flow rate of 80 μL/min 
with CoFe 2O4. The synergistic effect of Co-Fe enhances both H2 gas yield 
and carbon conversion. However, at higher steam flow rates, the for-
mation of the Fe3C phase inhibits H2 gas production. In the chemical 
looping process, CoFe 2O4 exhibits relative stability after three cycles.
In future research, promoting lattice oxygen transformation and 
reducing lattice size could enhance the redox capability in the chemical

TarGranular calcium oxide was used in syngas conditioning to investigate its impact on tar composition, concen-
tration, dew point and syngas yield during gasi ﬁcation of fuel cane bagasse (FCB). The results showed that the
use of 2, 3 and 6 wt.% in-bed CaO promoted the conversion of Class1, 4 and 5 tars to Class 3 tars to varyingdegrees. Overall, this resulted in a decrease in tar yield ranging from 16 to 35%, a decrease in the tar concen-
tration in syngas of 44 –80%, an increase in syngas yield of 17 –37%, and a decrease in tar dew point of
37–60 °C as the CaO concentration was increased from 2 to 6 wt.% .

1. Introduction
Gasiﬁcation is the conversion of solid organic material into a syn-
gas rich in H 2and CO by partial oxidation at temperatures greater
than 500 °C [1]. It has emerged as one of the primary energy conver-
sion technologies for sustainable energy production, particularly from
low heating value biomass residues, due to the higher ef ﬁciencies of
conversion of fuel to energy as compared to combustion.
During gasi ﬁcation condensable organic compounds known as tars
are produced and become entrained in the syngas [2,3]. Tars can cause
widespread fouling of operating equipment as they can condense on
downstream users causing extensive coking of heat exchangers and
plugging of valves. Consequently in most post gasi ﬁcation applica-
tions, including power generation and gas to liquid conversion, tars
must be removed to varying degrees using various techniques [2].
Biomass fuels high in lignin such as fuel cane bagasse (FCB), yield
higher concentrations of tar compared with other fuels such as bone
meal or municipal solid waste which contain catalytic contaminants
useful in tar cracking [4–7]. According to van Paasen and Kiel [8]these
compounds can be classi ﬁed into ﬁve classes on the basis of their con-
densation b",301,"[-0.03202988  0.05085313  0.0213153  ...  0.03162508  0.01564809

the potential for condensation of a given composition of tars isdetermined by calculating the tar dew point which is de ﬁned as the
temperature at which the real total partial pressure of tar equals the sat-
uration pressure of tar [9]. Since tars can condense and deposit unto sur-
faces when cooling of syngas occurs, determination of the tar dew point
is a major consideration for commercialisation of biomass gasi ﬁcation
systems as it facilitates an evaluation of the potential impact on down-
stream equipment. The classi ﬁcation system outlined by van Paasen
and Kiel [8]and the tar dew point for each class are outlined in Table 1 .
Evidently, the concentrations of separate tar compounds have lim-
ited practical usefulness; instead, the tar dew point is a critical mea-
sure of the overall effect of tars on downstream operating systems.
It can be seen from Table 1 that at very low concentrations of Class
4 and 5 tars, these compounds will condense even at high tempera-
tures. Conversely, Class 2 and 3 tars condense only at extremely
high concentrations and temperatures below 0 °C [8].
Tars not only cause fouling of downstream process equipment but
can represent as much as 10% of the low heati",293,"[-0.01833501  0.01836083  0.00885762 ...  0.02494594  0.01270539

produced which is lost to the syngas if not converted to H 2, CO and
CH4[9,10] . The production of tar therefore lowers the overall conver-
sion ef ﬁciency of biomass to syngas and increases the capital operat-
ing costs. Consequently the reduction and/or removal of tar from
syngas is critical to the widespread development of commercial
small-scale biomass gasi ﬁer systems since syngas from air blown gas-
iﬁers has relatively low calori ﬁc value compared with natural gas.
Currently, the preferred option for tar reduction is in the gasi ﬁer itself
through process control and the use of primary measures such as addi-
tives and catalysts which modify gasi ﬁcation conditions [5–7,10–14].Fuel Processing Technology 106 (2013) 654 –660

sugar factory where sugar was extracted within 48 h of harvesting. To
avoid changes in biomass structure caused by complete drying, the ba-
gasse produced was then air dried outdoors in covered areas at ambient
conditions (32 °C) to a moisture content of 20 –25 wt.%. After drying, the
bagasse was sealed in polypropylene bags and shipped over a two weekperiod to the United Kingdom for use in this study. On arrival at the lab-
oratory in the UK, the FCB was air dried indoors at laboratory-ambient
conditions. During this time the heaps were mixed every two days to en-
sure even drying and the moisture content monitored periodically until
equilibrium with the ambient atmosphere (9.4 –10 wt.%, dry basis) was
obtained. It was then shredded in a hammer mill and pelletised into
8 mm diameter pellets using a Swedish",399,[0.02546067 0.02496425 0.03754436 ... 0.00742657 0.01035932 0.0104181 ]

2.2. 50 kWe air-blown downdraft gasi ﬁer
A schematic of the downdraft gasi ﬁer system used in this work is
shown in Fig. 1 . Gasi ﬁcation of FCB was carried out at atmospheric
pressure in an intensi ﬁed autothermal air-blown 50 kWe throated
downdraft gasi ﬁer[21] which is illustrated diagrammatically in
Fig. 1 . The reactor has a double wall and heat loss is further reduced
byﬁbreglass lagging which covers the outer shell. The basic gasi ﬁca-
tion system was described in [4,5,22] and has been scaled up to
2 MWe for commercial applications. The performance of the gasi ﬁers
at 50 kWe and 1 MWe levels was compared and found to be very
similar [4,5,22] .
Brieﬂy, fuel is batch fed manually into the reactor through the
hopper at the top; after loading the gasi ﬁer the induced draft fan is
switched on and the reactor started by manually lighting the air
inlet ports with a butane torch. Air, the gasifying agent, is sucked
into the gasi ﬁer through the main air inlet valve at a controlled ﬂow
rate and into the chamber surrounding the throat by the induced
draft fan. From there the air then ﬂows into the oxidation zone
through a plane of air nozzles. The syngas generated in the gasi ﬁer
is then extracted from the reactor by the suction effect of the induced
draft fan. As the solid fuel is converted to syngas, this causes the
remaining fuel to ﬂow down through the reactor under gravity",448,"[ 0.01055486  0.00772526  0.02510068 ... -0.02016011  0.00780867

were mixed manually at 2 wt.%, 3 wt.% and 6 wt.% respectively. The
mixed materials were carefully loaded into the gasi ﬁer to avoid segre-
gation of the CaO and pellets. No additional runs were carried out
with a higher percentage content of CaO due to the unavailability of pel-

Tar sampling was carried out according to the draft Tar Protocol
CEN/TS 15439:2006 [23] with some modi ﬁcation. Samples of syngas
were extracted at gas tight sample ports under isothermal conditions
and at a constant ﬂow rate for a minimum period of 1 h from the syn-
gas stream at sampling points S2 and S3 ( Fig. 1 ). To prevent conden-
sation and/or thermal decomposition of target analytes in the sample
line, the line was trace heated to 300 °C for the duration of sample
collection. The syngas was then bubbled through a heated glass
ﬁbre thimble ﬁlter at a ﬂow rate of 0.6 Nm3h−1into a series of
three impingers heated to 40 °C and another three contained in a
salt and ice bath at −12 °C (standard conditions are de ﬁned here
according to NIST as 293.15 K and 101.325 kPa) ( Fig. 2 ). All the
impingers contained isopropanol (99.9%) and after ﬂow through the
impingers the syngas stream was discharged to the atmosphere.
On completion of sample collection, the isopropanol in the
impingers was mixed, the impingers and tubing were rinsed with ad-

der added to the stored solution collected from the impingers. After
Soxhlet extraction the glass ﬁbreﬁlter thimbles were dried in an
oven at 105 °C overnight and then cooled in a dessicator. The differ-
ence in mass between the initial ﬁlter used and the extracted ﬁlter
represent the mass of particulate matter contained in the sampled
syngas. To determine the mass of gravimetric tar contained in the ﬁl-
ters, the 100 ml extract was evaporated at 55 °C and 180 mbar using
a rotary evaporator and the mass of the residue was recorded. Deter-
mination of the GC-detectable tar content of the gravimetric tar was

dew point was calculated as outlined in Section 2.4.4 . The data col-
lected on the reduction in tar yield using in-bed CaO also showed
that this was associated with a signi ﬁcant change in tar composition
and therefore tar dew point. The overall impact of the use of in-bed
CaO on tar composition is illustrated in Fig. 4 , where it can readily
be seen that 3 wt.% and 6 wt.% CaO showed considerable activity to-
wards decomposition of Class 1 and 5 tars. From the data presented
inFig. 4 , it is evident that the addition of 2 wt.% CaO resulted in a sig-
niﬁcant reduction in Class 1, 4 and 5 tars. Class 1 tars were reduced
from 10% to less than 4%, Class 4 tars from 21% to less than 10% andClass 5 tars from 21% to less than 1%. Increasing the percentage con-
tent of CaO to 3 wt.% eliminated the production of Class 1 and 5 tars
and reduced the occurrence of Class 4 tars to 8%.
However, there was an increase in the occurrence of Class 2 and 3 tars
of 28% and 4% respectively. This further supports the observation that

cracking and ring opening reactions amongst Class 1, 4 and 5 tarswould lead to the production of straight chain compounds and those
with fewer rings. Increasing the in bed CaO to 6 wt.% further reduced
the Class 4 tars to 5%. This was accompanied by an increase of 23% and
24% in the Class 2 and Class 3 tars respectively. Since Class 5 tars domi-
nate the tar dew point, the absence of these in the tar produced after ad-
dition of CaO reduced the tar dew point to 30 °C an overall reduction of
61 °C. Also as there was no evidence of the existence of Class 1 tars with
the addition of 3 wt.% and 6 wt.% CaO, the tar dew point calculated rep-
resented the true dew point of the tar produced.
The tars which were absent from the samples collected were the 4
ring and larger PAHs, and the overall effect therefore of CaO on tar
production here was an increase in Class 3 tars which are the light ar-
omatic 1-ring compounds which pose limited problems with respect
to condensability and water solubility ( Table 5 ).
The disappearance of 4-ring and large PAHs was also reported by
Yongbin et al., (2004) when CaO was added during gasi ﬁcation of
coal tar, and they concluded that this was as a result of rupturing of
the PAH ring structures. The data produced provides strong evidence
that the increase in syngas yield and in Class 3 tars with the addition
of CaO was a direct consequence of decomposition of these large
PAHs. Given the increase in H

It is widely accepted that the potential for condensation and depo-
sition of tar is dependent on the composition and the chemical prop-
erties of the component compounds. According to van Paasen and
Kiel, [8]and Li et al., [30] even at concentrations of approximately
0.1 mg Nm−3Class 5 tars have a tar dew point of 120 °C which ex-
ceeds the dew point at which condensation of Class 2, 3 and 4 tars
even at concentrations in excess of 1000 mg Nm−3would occur.Table 3

fuel used in this investigation was selected speci ﬁcally due to the
expected high tar levels as a result of its high lignin content [3,21] .
The results show that the tar produced by FCB under optimal gas-
iﬁcation conditions is primarily lignin derived tar and is dominated by
Class 2 and 5 tars. Additionally 10% of the total tar produced is com-
prised of Class 1 tars and as a consequence the true tar dew point is
higher than the calculated average value of 90±6 °C. It has also
been shown that a reduction in the true tar dew point to between
30 and 32 °C can be achieved through the use of 3 wt.% and 6 wt.%
in-bed CaO which catalyses the destruction of Class 1 tars and/or
their precursor compounds. Of the three quantities of in-bed CaO

potassium concentrations (mKNO3) shows that these parameters have obvious effects on biomass CLG, and the 
highest hydrogen yield of 1.79 L is obtained at Ω 0.2, T 750 •C and mKNO3 8%. The kinetic and ther-
modynamic analysis further verifies that KNO 3-containing acetic acid liquid waste boosts biomass CLG for 
hydrogen generation. The proposed CLG strategy has dual advantages of waste treatment and energy conversion.   
1.Introduction 
Chemical looping gasification (CLG) between Fe2O3 and biomass to 
produce hydrogen has attracted the researcher ’s great attentions [1,2], 
since Fe2O3 is environmental friendliness, cheap, and heat-stable 
resource widely distributed on the earth with suitable redox thermo -
dynamic properties for the CLG reaction to produce hydrogen [3,4]. The 
CLG schematic diagram is illustrated in Fig. 1. In the fuel reactor (FR), 
Fe2O3 partially oxidizes the pyrolysis/gasification products of biomass 
into CO, CO2, and H2, et al. During this process, Fe2O3 is reduced into 
FeO or Fe, which is oxidized at the same process by the steam to release 
H2, high H2/CO syngas can therefore be generat",315,"[ 0.00962857  0.03350146  0.0076433  ... -0.00589998  0.00918809

E:\\PINNs-Research\\Searched Articles\\Efficient strategy of utilizing alkaline liquid waste boosting biomass.pdf,1,3,"ed [3,5]. Then the solid 
mixture from FR is transferred to the air reactor (AR), where it is 
oxidized into Fe2O3 for the next CLG cycle. 
In recent years, researches on CLG have mainly focused on reaction 
characteristics [6–9], multi-component carrier [10–12], reactor 
[13,14], system coupling [15–18] and process reinforcement [19,20]. 
Although it is found that alkali metal elements can significantly improve 
the activity of Fe2O3 for catalytic dissociation and gasification of 
biomass [21–24], as well as for coal chemical looping process [25,26], 
economical and feasible alkali modification of Fe2O3 still needs to be 
solved [27]. However, we tend to overlook the problem that a great amount of alkaline organic liquid waste is emitted from basic chemical 
raw material manufacturing, coal chemical, petrochemical, printing and 
dyeing, pesticide, and other industries. The alkaline organic liquid waste 
can be regarded as an important source of alkali (such as NaCl, Na2SO4, 
Na2CO3, K2CO3, and KNO 3) to modify Fe2O3, and the CLG of the liquid 
waste can not only recover the heat of organic components but also 
avoid the defects of secondary pollution (emission of NOx and CO2) 
caused by traditional incineration methods [28–30]",322,"[ 0.01758651  0.04228193  0.03016954 ...  0.01700442 -0.01512192

E:\\PINNs-Research\\Searched Articles\\Efficient strategy of utilizing alkaline liquid waste boosting biomass.pdf,1,4,". Theoretically, the 
CLG of the mixture of alkaline organic liquid waste and biomass can 
perfectly solve the problems related to the activity of Fe2O3 and the 
insufficient gasification agent. However, there has not been an attempt 
at this strategy, and the reaction characteristics of this CLG reaction 
system is lack of research. 
Therefore, experiments of corn stalk CLG using KNO 3-containing 
acetic acid aqueous solution as the simulated liquid waste under various 
conditions were performed to reveal the characteristics of the CLG re-
actions. Thermodynamics and reaction kinetics under the optimal 
operating conditions for high carbon conversion rate and H2 yield are 
further discussed to prove the positive effect of introducing KNO 3-con-
taining acetic acid solution for Fe2O3-based biomass CLG.

In the CLG system, feedstocks involved include the Fe2O3 supported 
on Al2O3 (Fe2O3/Al2O3) as the oxygen carrier (OC), corn stalks, and 
KNO 3-containing acetic acid aqueous solution. KNO 3-containing acetic 
acid aqueous solutions were prepared as the model liquid wastes. Fe2O3/ 
Al2O3 with 60 wt% Fe2O3 and 40 wt% Al2O3 was prepared following the 
reported impregnation method [6], for which Al2O3 powder was mixed 
into saturated Fe(NO 3)3 aqueous solution under continuous stirring. 
Then the mixture was dried for 8 h at 100 •C and the dried product was 
calcined at 900 •C for 1.5 h. The prepared Fe2O3/Al2O3 was ground into 
the powder with a diameter of 60–80 mesh for the CLG experiments. 6 
wt% acetic acid solution prepared by dissolving acetic acid in deionized 
water was used to simulate the acetic acid liquid waste.

3.Results and discussion 
3.1. Gasification reaction characteristics under different Ω 
Oxygen excess ratio (Ω) is defined as the ratio of the lattice oxygen in 
the OC to the oxygen consumed for complete oxidation of the fuel [31]. 
Ω acts as one of the most important factors affecting the CLG process. 
The effects of Ω (ranging from 0.2 to 1.0) on the biomass CLG driven by 
KNO 3-containing acetic acid were investigated under T 800 •C and

in Fig. 3, More CH4, CO2, and CO are generated at Ω 0.2 than the other 
cases, since the increase of Ω favors the oxidation reactions (R6–R8) 
leading to the reduction of these gases [32]. The maximum H2 flow rate 
reaches 83.47 mL/min at Ω 0.2, and the obvious H2 flow rate at 
around 5 min could be attributed to the steam reforming reactions 
(R2–R5) [33,34]. During the first 10 min of the reaction, H2 and CO2 act 
as the main products, while CH4 mainly derives from the pyrolysis of 
biomass and acetic acid (R1) keeping at a low proportion.

In Fig. 3d, Ω 0.2 contributes to the highest H2 yield of 0.98 L. 
Under the case of Ω 0.2, Fe2O3 can be reduced into FeO and Fe [35]. 
With the participation of water vapor, the reaction R5 will be signifi -
cantly improved to promote the generation of H2 [34,35]. But with the 
increase of Ω, the proportion of the oxidation reaction R7 is higher than 
that of the H2 generation reactions, resulting in a decrease of H2 pro-
duction [32,36]. When the Ω is 0.2, the content of CO is maintained at a 
relatively low level, and the maximum output is 71.7 mL since CO is 
easily oxidized by the OC following the R9 reaction [37] showing the

Fig. 4 shows the volume flow rate for the generated gases in the CLG

flow rate under Ω of 0.2 can maintain an upward trend from 5 min and 
reach a maximum value at 35 min, 59.9 mL/min. Since the dripping of 
the liquid waste, the proportion of R2 [38], R5, and R9 is enhanced, 
resulting in high H2 production. In Fig. 4d, at 750 •C and Ω 0.2, the H2 
yield is the highest, reaching 1.79 L, and the ηC is the highest, reaching

This step is an exothermic reaction, where 0.0043 mol Fe2O3 was 
reduced and the calculated reaction enthalpy is  0.512 kJ. Therefore, 
the total reaction enthalpy for reforming the biomass is 0.115 kJ. 
However, the complete CLG system includes the fuel gasification process 
and the reduced OC oxidation process. Oxidation of 0.0046 mol Fe3O4, 
0.0159 mol FeO, and 0.0006 mol Fe can release the heat of  3.02 kJ, 
which can balance the heat required for the gasification of acetic acid 
and biomass. 
3.7. Structural characterizations 
Fig. 9 depicts the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and the scanning 
electron microscopy (SEM) imagines for the pure Fe2O3/Al2O3 and the 
K-modified Fe2O3/Al2O3. According to the XRD, the diffraction peaks 
correspond to a different facet of Fe2O3, which indicates that the pure 
Fe2O3/Al2O3 has a high degree of crystallini",473,"[ 0.04426634  0.02919046 -0.00331177 ...  0.01618957 -0.01098452

E:\\PINNs-Research\\Searched Articles\\Efficient strategy of utilizing alkaline liquid waste boosting biomass.pdf,7,3,"ty. The absence of Al2O3 
diffraction peak indicates that Al2O3 is covered by Fe2O3. The XRD 
pattern of Fe2O3/Al2O3 modified with 8% KNO 3 solution appears crystal 
planes of KNO 2 [200] and Al2O3. This may be due to the thermal 
decomposition of KNO 3 into KNO 2, which changes the distribution of 
Fe2O3 on the Al2O3 crystal plane. The SEM results show that, in com-
parison with the surface of Fe2O3/Al2O3, the K-modified Fe2O3/Al2O3 
shows particles of different sizes on its rough surface. The rough surface 
can be attributed to the nitrogen-containing gas released from the 
thermal decomposition of KNO 3, which changes the pore structure and 
the distribution of Fe2O3. Besides, the regeneration and reaction sta-
bility of Fe2O3-based OC has been verified [55]. 
Fig. 10 further shows the SEM image, energy dispersive spectrometer 
(EDS) analysis, and XRD pattern for the K-modified Fe2O3/Al2O3 after 
the reaction. It can be observed that the rough surface and holes of the K- 
modified Fe2O3/Al2O3 sample were destroyed after the reaction, 
showing the traces of sintering among particles, which causes Table 3

Emissions of global greenhouse gases are accelerating because of the growing demand for and 
consumption of fossil fuels as the source of hydrogen. Without action to curb CO 2 emissions, it is 
impossible to limit global average temperature increases to 2 °C above pre-industrial levels [1]. Facing 
this problem, the scientists have been carrying out a series of studies to improve environmental 
conditions. In terms of energy, renewable energy sources such as biomas",97,"[ 0.04756586  0.02442571  0.05082568 ... -0.00573625 -0.00705912

dustrial utilization remains constrained by challenges associated with surface hardness and high-temperature 
passivation. In this investigation, we adopted an innovative methodology that integrates physical grinding 
and chemical surface modification to in situ transform Al2O3 into NaAlO 2 within EAFS. NaAlO 2, distinguished by 
its elevated melting point and catalytic activity, emerges as a superior alternative to the conventional biomass 
gasification catalyst, Na2CO3, as it effectively mitigates issues such as slagging, fouling, corrosion, and alkali 
metal volatilization. Moreover, NaAlO 2 facilitates the cleavage of macromolecular bonds in biomass during the 
early stages of gasification, thereby promoting the generation of small-molecule gases, and serves as a catalyst in 
the reduction reaction between Fe2O3/EAFS and gaseous organic molecules. Utilizing NaAlO 2-Fe2O3/EAFS as the 
oxygen carrier, our experiments demonstrated an optimal hydrogen generation rate of 0.559 L per 0.5 g of 
material at 750 •C, with an excess oxygen ratio (Ω) of 0.2. Thermodynamic and kinetic analyses further

1.Introduction
Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) [1], an advanced combustion 
technology, attracts widespread attention. The revolutionary concept 
behind this technology involves moving away from the direct contact 
between oxygen and fuel in traditional air combustion processes, instead 
utilizing metal or non-metal oxygen carriers (OCs) as intermediates for 
the oxidation reaction. In the CLC system, OC first react with oxygen to 
acquire oxygen atoms, which are then transferred to the fuel for com-
bustion, thereby preventing the formation of harmful NOx pollutants 
through the combination of nitrogen and oxygen at high temperatures. 
Moreover, the separation of CO2 from the unreacted OC after combustion provides unprecedented convenience for the efficient cap-
ture and storage of CO2 [2], making CLC a prominen",249,"[ 0.03295739 -0.00595431  0.02577499 ...  0.00779495 -0.01790797

nology for future low-carbon energy conversion. This principle is also 
applicable to Chemical Looping Gasification (CLG), which involves a 
two-step reaction process: fuel reacts with OC in a nitrogen-free atmo -
sphere to produce syngas (mainly consisting of H2 and CO), followed by 
a oxidation step to recover the OC for recycling [3–5]. Fan et al. have 
further explored the application of CLG for large-scale hydrogen pro-
duction [6], highlighting its advantages over traditional gasification 
methods, including lower costs, effective utilization of OC as a heat 
source, high purity of produced syngas, reduced tar formation, and 
significantly lower emissions of pollutants during the gasification

2process [7–13].
Currently, OCs used in CLG primarily consist of transition metal 
oxides such as Ni, Cu, Fe, and Mn. Fe-based OCs are particularly prev-
alent in CLG applications for processing organic solid waste, especially 
in the “steam-iron cycle ” process [14–16]. Their widespread use is 
attributed to their low cost, environmental sustainability, high me-
chanical strength, and exceptional resistance to sintering, making them 
a focus of extensive research [17–21]. To enhance the stability and 
reactivity of Fe-based OCs, researchers have explored the incorporation 
of inert supports to improve both their physical and chemical properties. 
Inert supports, such as Al2O3, provide robust structural reinforcement 
while also being economical, non-toxic, and safe. Inert supports improve 
the mechanical durability of OCs, increase porosity and specific surface 
area, and effectively mitigate sintering during extended operation, 
thereby prolonging the lifespan of the OCs [22–24]. Modifying the inert 
support not only enhances lattice oxygen transfer properties but also 
improves the mechanical characteristics of OCs. By optimizing the 
impregnation process and constructing an MgO/TiO 2 inert support, 
research has shown that this approach can enhance sintering resistance 
and crushing strength of OCs during cycling [25]. In a separate study, 
Fe2O3/ZrO 2 was combined with organic compounds, followed by the 
removal of these organics at high temperatures to form a porous ZrO 2 
shell. The resulting OCs exhibited a stable pore structure, specific sur-
face area, and core –shell morphology, demonstrating excellent redox 
activity and sintering resistance [26].
Electric arc furnace slag (EAFS), a by-product of industrial smelting, 
is commonly recycled as a flux in blast furnace smelting, reintegrated 
into steelmaking processes, utilized in hot metal pretreatment, and 
repurposed for the production of construction materials, fertilizer",445,"[ 0.01392625  0.03117488  0.00989788 ...  0.0016136  -0.00366499

soil amendments [27–32]. Despite the maturity of existing slag recycling 
technologies, the overall utilization rate of EAFS remains suboptimal, 
with certain valuable elements in the slag not fully recovered or lever-
aged for high-value-added applications [33–46]. EAFS is rich in CaO, 
MgO, MnO, and Al2O3, along with significant amounts of FeO and Fe. 
These characteristics make EAFS a suitable material as an OC for CLG 
processes. Studies have confirmed the feasibility of using steel converter 
slag as an OC in CLG processes [47,48] . It has been found that EAFS 
exhibits a higher carbon conversion rate and stable reactivity compared 
to other types of slag [49]. One study assessed EAFS as an OC in fuel CLC 
processes under 800 •C fluidized bed conditions over 50 cycles, 
achieving a fuel gas conversion rate exceeding 85 % [50,51] . Another 
investigation demonstrated that transforming calcium-containing com-
ponents in steel slag into CaSO 4 through a pre-sulfating step can achieve 
almost complete CO conversion at temperatures below 800 •C during 
the CLC process [52]. The reactivity of OCs can be enhanced through 
both alkali impregnation and acid impregnation. Alkali impregnation 
facilitates the formation of an intermediate C-O-M structure within OC, 
which alters the electron cloud density on the coke surface, weakens C–C 
bonds, promotes the adsorption of CO2 and H2O molecules, and accel -
erates the gasification reaction [53,54] . Acid impregnation increases the 
surface area and porosity of oxygen carriers, thereby enhancing their 
reactivity. Furthermore, it has been observed that acid modification 
significantly improves the generation rate and selectivity of C2 oxygen- 
containing compounds on certain catalyst supports [55].

slags and the requisite characteristics for CLG OCs, along with the

E:\\PINNs-Research\\Searched Articles\\Enhancing biomass chemical looping gasification for hydrogen produ.pdf,2,3,"this study presents a novel approach by entailing the physical 
modification and chemical activation of industrial waste slags to convert 
them into high-performance OCs for low-grade fuel CLG hydrogen 
production. Specifically, in situ conversion of Al2O3 in EAFS to NaAlO 2 
through chemical activation enhances the early stages of biomass gasi-
fication by promoting bond cleavage and small molecular gas formation. 
Additionally, the high melting point of NaAlO 2 effectively mitigates 
common operational issues such as slagging, fouling, corrosion, and 
alkali metal volatilization. This transformation not only optimizes the utilization of waste slag resources but also markedly improves hydrogen 
production efficiency and the overall performance of the CLG system. 
Such advancements contribute significantly to the development of sus-
tainable and eco-friendly energy technologies on both a national and 
global scale.
2.Methods
2.1. Materials
In the CLG process, corn stalk is employed as the biomass feedstock, 
while Fe2O3 serves as the OC, supported on EAFS, blast furnace slag 
(BFS), and Al2O3. These materials are designated as Fe2O3/EAFS, Fe2O3/ 
BFS, and Fe2O3/Al2O3, respectively. The raw EAFS and BFS were 
sourced from Fujian Sanbao Steel Co., Ltd. The proximate analysis and 
ultimate analysis of the corn stalk were shown in Table 1. The elemental 
compositions and concentrations of EAFS and BFS are provided in 
Table 2.
To enhance loading efficiency and improve reaction activity, the slag 
underwent a series of surface activation modifications, including alkali 
impregnation, acid impregnation, and mechanical milling. During the 
alkali impregnation step, the carrier particles were treated with a 1 mol/ 
L NaOH solution for 3 h to facilitate effective leaching and chemical 
conversion. Subsequently, the modified material was dried and solidi -
fied at a constant temperature of 80 •C for 8 h, ensuring thorough 
dehydration and stabilization of the introd",452,"[ 0.02970028  0.03001884  0.02957775 ...  0.01336757 -0.01753346

E:\\PINNs-Research\\Searched Articles\\Enhancing biomass chemical looping gasification for hydrogen produ.pdf,2,4,"uced chemical functionalities.
During the acid impregnation phase, 1 mol/L acetic acid (HAC) so-
lution was utilized as the modifying medium. The carrier particles were 
immersed for 3 h to facilitate the extraction or alteration of chemical 
components, promoting modifications in surface structure. Following 
the acid treatment, the same drying protocol was applied, where the 
material was dried at 80 •C for 8 h to achieve the desired physical state.
In the subsequent mechanical milling process, the impregnated slag 
carrier particles were uniformly mixed with deionized water and sub-
jected to fine milling for several hours to reduce particle size, increase 
specific surface area, and enhance surface roughness. After milling, 
solid –liquid separation was performed through filtration, and the solid 
phase was dried at a constant temperature of 80 •C for 8 h, yielding fully 
activated and modified slag carrier materials with improved 
performance.
Three iron-based OCs (Fe2O3/EAFS, Fe2O3/BFS, and Fe2O3/Al2O3) 
were prepared via the impregnation method [56], with the active Fe2O3 
content maintained at 60 wt%. In this process, EAFS (or BFS and Al2O3) 
was first thoroughly mixed with a saturated aqueous solution of Fe 
(NO 3)3 under continuous stirring. The mixture was then dried at 100 •C 
for 8 h. In cases where Al2O3 served as the carrier, the dried product was 
further ground into a fine powder with a particle size between 60 and 80 
mesh. These powders were subsequently employed in biomass CLG- 
related experimental studies.

3.Results and discussion
3.1. Effect of different slags
In the biomass CLG process, the OC serves a dual role as both an 
oxidant, facilitating partial oxidation of the fuel, and as a catalyst, 
enhancing carbon conversion and gasification reactions [11–17]. A 
comparative analysis of corn stalk CLG was conducted using Fe2O3/ 
EAFS, Fe2O3/BFS, Fe2O3/WSCR, and Fe2O3/Al2O3 as OCs at a temper -
ature of 800 •C and Ω of 0.2. The performance results are illustrated in 
Fig. 2. Fe2O3/BFS exhibited the lowest hydrogen production rate, with a 
maximum flow rate of 6.2 mL/min. Conversely, Fe2O3/Al2O3 and 
Fe2O3/EAFS achieved significantly higher maximum hydrogen flow 
rates of 21.6 mL/min and 26.8 mL/min, respectively. The cumulative 
hydrogen yields for Fe2O3/Al2O3 and Fe2O3/EAFS were comparable. 
Notably, even in the absence of surface modification, EAFS loaded with 
Fe2O3 demonstrated superior catalytic activity compared to BFS. This 
enhanced performance is likely due to the higher iron content and lower 
silicon content in EAFS (Table 1). The elevated SiO2 concentration in 
BFS can lead to the formation of inert Fe2SiO4 under high-temperature 
conditions, which impedes the catalytic partial oxida",412,"[ 0.00972162  0.01938905  0.00019265 ...  0.01434871 -0.00497259

E:\\PINNs-Research\\Searched Articles\\Enhancing biomass chemical looping gasification for hydrogen produ.pdf,4,2,"tion of corn stalks 
[58]. Additionally, while the Al2O3 content in untreated EAFS is lower 
than that in BFS, its multi-component composition and boundary effects 
confer catalytic properties similar to Al2O3. For instance, the high Mg/Al 
ratio in EAFS has been shown to regulate the Fe2/Fe3ratio, thereby 
promoting lattice oxygen migration in Fe2O3 and enhancing its reac-
tivity [59]. Furthermore, the multiphase Mn-Fe-Al-O system exhibits 
significantly improved reducibility of Fe2O3 and increased hydrogen 
production compared to the Fe-Al-O system [60]. Subsequent sections 
will explore the impact of surface structural and compositional changes 
in EAFS on its performance characteristics.
3.2. Effects of surface modification
The effect of EAFS modification on the reactivity of Fe2O3/EAFS was 
further investigated. Given that EAFS has a vitreous structure with a 
relatively hard surface, it was ground, and its surface was treated with 
acid and alkali, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, the surface of Fe2O3/ 
raw EAFS is rough and irregular, with numerous pores. After grinding, 
the particles became more regular and uniform. However, following 
different activation treatments, structural modifications were evident in 
the Fe2O3/EAFS samples, including a reduction in pore size and a 
smoother surface. The specific surface area and pore volume of EAFS after various treatments a",336,"[ 0.02711268 -0.01354412  0.0451552  ...  0.03283348 -0.01436312

E:\\PINNs-Research\\Searched Articles\\Enhancing biomass chemical looping gasification for hydrogen produ.pdf,4,3,"re presented in Table 3. Neither physical 
grinding nor acetic acid washing after grinding significantly altered the 
specific surface area or pore volume of the samples. Physical grinding 
primarily breaks up the adhesion between EAFS particles without 
affecting the internal pore volume of each particle. After acid etching, 
SEM analysis revealed the formation of new particle adhesion, resulting 
in a strip-like structure. However, as shown in Fig. 3d, after NaOH 
treatment, finer particles were generated on the surface, potentially 
blocking some of the EAFS pores. This resulted in a reduction of specific 
surface area and pore volume to half of that observed in the untreated 
sample.
Corn stalk CLG experiments were conducted at a constant tempera -
ture of 800 •C and an Ω of 0.2. Fig. 4presents a comparative analysis of 
the performance of OCs prepared from EAFS, following various surface 
physical and chemical modifications, in the hydrogen production pro-
cess. Specifically, Fig 4a compares the hydrogen production perfor -
mance of Fe2O3/EAFS after 1 h and 3 h grinding treatments. The results 
show that the Fe2O3/EAFS sample ground for 1 h produced a maximum 
hydrogen flow rate of 5.5 mL/min, while the sample subjected to 3 h of 
grinding achieved a higher hydrogen yield of 8.2 mL/min. However, it is 
important to note that, despite the improvement with extended 
grinding,",327,"[-0.01916876 -0.01014275  0.03988379 ...  0.00425836  0.0016337

E:\\PINNs-Research\\Searched Articles\\Enhancing biomass chemical looping gasification for hydrogen produ.pdf,4,4,"the maximum hydrogen production of both ground samples 
remained lower than that of the original, unground EAFS.
We further investigated the impact of acid and alkali immersion 
treatments on the catalytic activity of EAFS in the CLG process, with the 
relevant results presented in Fig. 4b. The performance of acid immersion 
treatment proved unsatisfactory; when EAFS was treated with a 1 mol/L 
HCl solution, the maximum hydrogen production rate achieved in the 
biomass CLG system using EAFS as the support was only 4.4 mL/min. In 
contrast, alkali immersion treatment demonstrated a potential to 
enhance reactivity under optimal conditions. Although treatment with 
0.5 mol/L and 1.2 mol/L NaOH solutions did not improve the maximum 
hydrogen flow rate, which remained at 17.9 mL/min and 12.8 mL/min, 
respectively, compared to untreated EAFS, a notable improvement was 
observed with 1 mol/L NaOH treatment. Under identical conditions 
(800 •C and Ω 0.2), the biomass CLG system using EAFS as the support 
achieved a significantly higher maximum hydrogen flow rate of 35.3 
mL/min.

6that, under these specific conditions, the interaction between the OC and 
biomass is more efficient, leading to enhanced hydrogen generation 
efficiency.
Further analysis indicates that at a gas flow rate of 0.2, the highest 
cumulative hydrogen production of 332.9 mL was achieved over the 
course of the experimental process. This result demonstrates that opti-
mizing the gas flow rate to 0.2 not only enhances the hydrogen pro-
duction rate per unit time but also increases the total hydrogen yield 
throughout the CLG process. These findings underscore the critical role

A comprehensive investigation was carried out using NaOH- 
modified Fe2O3/EAFS at Ω 0.2 to evaluate the efficiency of corn 
stalk CLG across different temperatures. The hydrogen production re-
sults at varying temperatures are depicted in Fig. 6. At temperature of 
700 •C, the catalytic activity of the OC was likely insufficient to effec-
tively drive the biomass gasification reaction, resulting in a low 
hydrogen production rate and indicating inefficient gasification at this 
temperature. However, when the temperature was increased to 750 •C, 
the hydrogen yield reached its peak at 559.4 mL. This result suggests 
that 750 •C may represent the optimal temperature,",211,"[ 0.01481802  0.01214706  0.03260893 ...  0.01109029 -0.0004471

exhibits moderate redox activity, facilitating efficient biomass gasifica -
tion without excessive oxidation that would otherwise convert hydrogen into water vapor. Conversely, at 800 •C, an unexpected decline in 
hydrogen production was observed, despite the anticipated increase in 
reaction rates at higher temperatures. At this point, the heightened 
oxidation activity of the OC surpassed the ideal reduction –oxidation 
equilibrium, leading to substantial recombination of hydrogen and ox-
ygen to form water [61]. Furthermore, intensified oxidation of carbon- 
based compounds, including CH4 and CO, contributed to a reduction 
in net hydrogen yield, thereby decreasing the overall energy conversion 
efficiency of the system. Based on the experimental data, 750 •C was 
determined to be the optimal temperature for maximizing hydrogen 
production under the conditions tested.

7attributed to the breakdown of the corn stalk lignocellulosic structure 
under elevated temperatures, which releases significant quantities of 
volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including water vapor, light hy-
drocarbons, and other gases [62]. The release of these volatiles creates 
additional surface area for the remaining solid residue to interact with 
both heat and OC (in this case, NaOH-modified Fe2O3/EAFS), thereby 
accelerating the overall rate of carbon conversion by promoting further 
decomposition reactions and accelerating the conversion of carbon into 
gaseous products. A peak in carbon conversion is observed around 80 
min, at which point the maximum carbon conversion rate reaches 0.03

the relevant thermodynamic parameters listed in Table 4.
Thermodynamic analyses were carried out for corn stalk CLG at 
750•C, Ω 0.2 and EAFS subjected to alkaline leaching with 1 mol/L 
NaOH, as this condition produces the highest gas yield and carbon conversion. For the CLG of C4H6O3, CH4 and CO were neglected in the

that the transfer of 0.064 mol of electrons reduces Fe2O3 to FeO and

3.7. Characterizations
To further elucidate the composition and structure of surface prod-
ucts treated with NaOH, elemental and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses 
were conducted. Table 5presents the chemical composition of raw EAFS 
alongside EAFS subjected to alkaline leaching with NaOH at concen -
trations of 1 mol/L, 0.5 mol/L, and 1.2 mol/L, as well as EAFS treated 
with 1 mol/L HAC acid leaching. A comparative analysis of the 
elemental composition across different surface treatments revealed a 
marked increase in surface Na content following alkali treatment.
In EAFS, the presence of Fe2O3, Al2O3, and Ca(OH) 2 can facilitate the 
formation of CaFe 2O4 at specific temperatures. However, the signifi -
cance of CaFe 2O4 as OC in this experiment is limited, as it requires 
temperatures near 1000 •C to exhibit superior oxygen-carrying capacity 
compared to Fe2O3 [62]. Notably, when the Al2O3 mass fraction drops 
below 1.5 %, CaFe 2O4 decomposes into magnetite and silicate melts. 
Conversely, when the Al2O3 mass fraction exceeds 2.5 %, the CaFe 2O4 
content in",403,[0.02751688 0.02565453 0.01092443 ... 0.01348853 0.01512821 0.01290824]

the Fe2O3/EAFS sample treated with 1 mol/L NaOH, which demon -
strated the highest H2 production, exhibits a reduced intensity of 
CaFe 2O4 diffraction peaks relative to other chemically activated Fe2O3/ 
EAFS samples.
NaAlO 2 is an effective catalyst for gasification, offering greater 
resistance to deactivation, lower sodium volatility, and higher ash fusion 
temperatures [57]. The treatment with 1 mol/L NaOH alkaline leaching 
facilitates the conversion of a significant portion of Al2O3 into NaAlO 2 
within the EAFS matrix. However, crystalline NaAlO 2 phases are not 
detected, likely due to the high dispersion of NaAlO 2 in an amorphous

The treatment of OCs with NaOH introduces Na on their surface, 
which exhibits fluidity and volatility [69]. This high volatility of Na can 
generate richer pore structures on the OCs’ surface, increasing the 
number of reactive sites available for gasification reactions [70]. Na can 
migrate to the interior of carbon grains to form intercalation com-
pounds, disrupting the regular microcrystalline structure of graphitized 
carbon and activating it into amorphous carbon. Na in NaAlO 2 forms the 
intermediate C-O-Na structure that alters the electron cloud density 
distribution on the surface of coke. This change reduces the strength of 
C–C bonds, making them more prone to fracture and forming CO 
[71–73]. The adjacent carbon atoms become positively charged, facili -
tating the adsorption of CO2 and H2O molecules onto these positively 
charged edge carbon atoms. The presence of CO2 and H2O enhances the 
oxidation of carbon atoms, leading to the formation of carbon oxides and 
accelerating the gasification reaction rate [53,54] . In addition, tradi",255,"[ 0.00670288  0.02143037 -0.00724435 ... -0.00067685  0.00156641

tional alkali metal catalysts such as Na2CO3 have high volatility, rapid 
loss of catalytic activity, and low ash melting temperature, which can 
easily lead to reactor corrosion and scaling. In contrast, NaAlO 2 has 
lower alkali volatility and higher ash melting temperature [74], which 
can alleviate corrosion and scaling problems and contributes to more 
efficient and sustainable gasification processes than traditional alkali 
metal catalysts [75,76] .
Consequently, optimizing activation methods is crucial for tailoring 
the composition and properties of Fe2O3/EAFS to enhance hydrogen 
production efficiency. In the future, we plan to develop an OC with a core –shell structure to further reduce alkali metal volatilization losses, 
while suppressing the migration of Fe ions from the interior to the sur-
face, avoiding the enrichment of metal Fe on the surface, and increasing 
the sintering resistance of OC. The shell can not only improve the sta-
bility of OC structure, but also promote the oxygen lattice transfer rate 
[77].

Biomass chemical looping gasification (CLG) is an efficient gasification technology, which enables the conversion 
of low-grade biomass into high-value hydrogen-rich syngas. Four Ca/Fe-based oxygen carriers with different 
molar ratios of Ca:Fe are synthesized using the sol–gel method, and the regulation mechanism of oxygen carriers 
is comprehensively investigated for the purpose of producing hydrogen-rich syngas during the biomass CLG 
process. First, these Ca/Fe-based oxygen carriers exhibit selective oxidation capabilities towards the pyrolysis 
and gasification products of biomass. The addition of Ca element significantly enhances the H2 concentration,

effect becomes prominent, meanwhile the contribution of active lattice oxygen diminishes. XRD analysis reveals 
that Ca2Fe2O5 exhibits the most effective catalytic ability for biochar conversion. Third, it is revealed that the 
catalytic effect of partially reduced oxygen carriers on the water –gas shift reaction, as well as the participation of 
deeply reduced oxygen carriers in the steam-iron reaction, together regulates the composition of syngas. The 
addition of Ca element significantly enhances their catalytic ability in the water –gas shift reaction. At equivalent 
temperatures, the Ca2Fe2O5 oxygen carrier achieves the highest CO conversion, demonstrating its advantages at 
producing hydrogen-rich syngas in CLG. Surprisingly, the Ca/Fe interaction significantly accelerates the steam- 
iron reaction rate. Additionally, the multiple cyclic redox experiments based on batch fluidized beds confirm the 
stable physicochemical characteristics of the Ca2Fe2O5 oxygen carrier, highlighting its potential for long-period 
operation and future industrial-scale implementation.

energy crisis has propelled the exploration of clean and renewable en-
ergy. Biomass energy, being one of the most valuable renewable energy 
sources, presents a viable solution for the optimization of the global 
energy framework [1]. Chemical looping gasification (CLG) represents 
an innovative and efficient gasification technique that enables the 
conversion of low-grade biomass into high-value syngas for applications 
such as hydrogen production, power generation, and Fischer-Tropsch 
synthesis [2,3] . In this process, the oxygen carrier (OC) circulates be-
tween the fuel reactor and the air reactor, realizing the transfer of lattice 
oxygen to partially oxidize the fuel and generate syngas. By utilizing 
lattice oxygen instead of conventional gasification media (e.g., air and 
oxygen), the CLG avoids syngas dilution or energy intensive air sepa-
ration units [4]. Additionally, the oxygen carrier serves as a heat carrier in the gasification system, ensuring the heat balance between two re-
actors [5].
Currently, thousands of OCs have been developed and evaluated 
mostly for chemical looping combustion (CLC), including Fe-based 
[6,7] , Cu-based [8,9] and Ni-based [10,11] OCs. These CLC-oriented",276,"[ 0.0206014   0.03334835  0.01417503 ...  0.00411235 -0.01143126

owing to their affordability, moderate reactivity, and environmental 
friendliness [13–15]. Besides, Fe-based OCs have the capacity to facili -
tate the cracking and reforming of tar during biomass gasification, 
thereby augmenting syngas yield [16]. In recent years, the focus of CLG 
research has shifted towards the design of composite OCs, and many 
researchers consider the doping of active metal oxides as a highly 
effective strategy to enhance the reactivity of Fe2O3 [17–19]. Huang

the incorporation of CuO as a means to enhance the reactivity of Fe2O3, 
and the results indicated that CuO doping significantly improved the 
carbon conversion rate. Nonetheless, due to the pronounced reactivity of 
CuO, the resulting syngas exhibited high CO2 concentration, which 
impeded the production of high-quality syngas. Similar observations 
were reported by Zhou et al. [20]when investigating the influence of Mn 
doping on the performance of Fe2O3 OCs.
The introduction of alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEM) into OCs 
is also considered an effective approach to enhancing the CLG perfor -
mance of Fe-based OCs [21–23]. Bao et al [24] studied the effect of 
AAEM such as K2CO3 and Na2CO3 on the reactivity of OCs. Compared 
with the unmodified OC, the ilmenite loaded with 15 wt% K exhibited 
approximately 8 times of reduction activity. Chen et al. [25]conducted a 
comparative study of the performance between red mud and synthetic 
Fe-based OCs in coal CLG experiments. The results showed that 
compared to Fe-based OC, red mud exhibited higher syngas yield and 
instantaneous carbon conversion rate, primarily attributed to the cata-
lytic effect of abundant alkali metals (Na) in red mud on coal conver -
sion. Recently, the alkaline earth metal CaO, with abundant reserves and 
economical price, has gained significant attention in the modification of 
Fe-based OCs [26–28]. It exhibits obvious catalytic effect on the gasifi -
cation reaction of biochar, which notably improves the conversion rate 
of solid fuel. Moreover, CaO possesses the advantage of reducing the CO2 
concentration in syngas, making it highly suitable for the production of 
high-quality syngas [29]. Wang et al. [30] optimized the molar ratio of 
CaO/Fe 2O3 in a CLG experiment utilizing lignite as fuel. The findings 
indicated that the H2/CO ratio and gas yield reached their maximum 
values of 4.6 and 1.4 Nm3/kg, respectively, when the CaO/Fe 2O3 ratio 
was 0.5:0.5. Hu et al. [31] discovered that two types of metal oxides 
(CaFe 2O4 and Ca2Fe2O5) were formed under different CaO/Fe 2O3 ratios. 
The biomass CLG results showed that both OCs contributed",580,"[ 0.02949861  0.0045874   0.0430838  ...  0.00841874 -0.00743466

E:\\PINNs-Research\\Searched Articles\\Exploring the regulation mechanism of CaFe-based oxygen carrier in biomass chemical looping gasification.pdf,2,2,"to the for-
mation of hydrogen-rich syngas. Specifically, Ca2Fe2O5 exhibited higher 
H2 yield, reaching 23.07 mmol/g biomass. Liu et al. [32] showed that, 
compared to Fe2O3, CaFe 2O4 and Ca2Fe2O5 did not spontaneously react 
with H2 and CO but exhibited a higher reactivity towards char and CH4. 
This characteristic was highly desirable for improving the yield and 
quality of syngas. It is worth noting that most studies on Ca/Fe-based 
OCs have been conducted using fixed-bed reactors [31–33], with few 
reports utilizing fluidized bed reactor [34]. It is widely recognized that 
interconnected fluidized bed reactors are the most suitable reactor type 
for chemical looping processes [35–37].
To date, research on Ca/Fe-based OCs has expanded into various 
fields, offering valuable insights for CLG investigations [38–42]. 
Antunes et al. [41] applied Ca2Fe2O5 in the catalytic domain. The 
research findings indicated that Ca2Fe2O5 significantly increased the H2 
content of biomass-derived gas by promoting the water –gas shift reac-
tion. Sun et al. [42] discovered that deeply reduced CaFe 2O4 and 
Ca2Fe2O5 could yield hydrogen with a purity of around 99 % through 
steam-iron reactions. Summarizing the current research status, the 
regulation of Ca/Fe-based OCs in biomass CLG can be categorized into 
four aspects: (1) The selective reaction of fresh OCs with gasification 
products (H2, CO, CH4, char and tar) aids in enhancing the yield and 
quality of syngas. (2) The presence of lattice oxygen within OCs and 
their inherent catalytic properties actively promotes the gasification 
reaction rate of biochar. (3) In the middle and late stages of gasification, 
reduced OCs (with a partial loss of lattice oxygen) exert a catalytic effect 
on the water –gas shift (WGS) reaction, thereby influencing the distri -
bution of syngas components. (4) During the CLG process, OCs may 
undergo deep reduction, and the steam-iron reaction of these low oxy-
gen potential iron oxides (Fe and FeO) also significantly affects the 
distribution of gasification products. There is an urgent need for sys-
tematic and comprehensive exploration of these complex regulatory 
mechanisms to facilitate the industrial scale-up and",547,"[ 0.02878145  0.01408454  0.02253526 ...  0.00837111 -0.00810167

Considering the aforementioned factors, four OCs with different Ca/ Fe molar ratios are prepared in this work. Meticulously designed ex-
periments are conducted to investigate the regulatory mechanism of Ca/ 
Fe-based OCs in biomass CLG. Firstly, the CLG performance of different 
OCs is comprehensively evaluated in a batch fluidized bed reactor, uti-
lizing biomass/biochar as fuel. Then, the study examines the positive 
influence of lattice oxygen and the catalytic properties of the OCs on the 
conversion rate of biochar. Subsequently, the regulatory effects of the 
WGS reaction and the steam-iron reaction on the distribution of gasifi -
cation products are systematically investigated. Lastly, the optimization 
of reaction conditions and multiple-cycle experiments are conducted in 
a batch fluidized bed reactor to assess the stability and durability of the 
OCs, providing support for the practical application of biomass CLG 
technology.

ratios (0:1, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1), are synthesized using the sol–gel method 
following the previously reported preparation procedure [43,44] . 
Briefly, Ca(NO 3)2⋅4H2O (purity ≽98.5 wt%, Sinopharm, AR) and Fe

deionized water with specific proportions, and citric acid (purity ≽99.5

The proximate and ultimate analyses of pine and pine char are listed in 
Table 1.
2.2. Experimental and procedure
Cyclic redox experiments are performed on four OCs using a ther-
mogravimetric analyzer (TGA) to evaluate the stability of the reaction. 
Each TGA experiment employs approximately 15 mg of OCs and main -
tains a reaction temperature of 850 ℃. The cycle consists of a 90s 
reduction stage (10 mL/min H2 90 mL/min Ar) and a 120 s oxidation 
stage (10 mL/min O2 90 mL/min Ar), between them purged with pure 
Ar (100 mL/min Ar) for 120 s.
The CLG experiments of biomass/biochar are carried out in a batch 
fluidized bed reactor (see Fig. 1). The reactor chamber is a quartz tube 
(internal diameter of 26 mm, length of 800 mm) with an air distribution 
plate inside the tube. The feed pipe (internal diameter of 8 mm) is 
positioned at a distance of 10 mm above the distribution plate, allowing 
for the controlled injection of biomass or biochar into the reactor using 
high-pressure N2 pulses. The syngas produced by gasification passes 
through filters and condensers to remove particles, tar and steam, and 
then enters the gas analyzer to measure the syngas composition. To 
ensure experimental accuracy, each experiment is repeated three times.
When investigating the effects of four OCs on biomass/biochar CLG, 
the operational parameters are consistently set as follows: gasification 
temperature 850℃, steam concentration 30 %, and oxygen-to-fuel ratio 
0.2 (See Formula 2, this value is calculated based on the CF OC). For the 
biomass CLG experiment, the reactor is filled with 7.03 g of OCs, and the 
height-diameter ratio of the bed material is approximately 1. Consid -

of the reactor reaches 850 ℃, a fluidized gas consisting of 1000 mL/min 
(300 mL/min H2O700 mL/min N2) is introduced. After stabilizing for 
10 min, 0.50 g of biomass is injected through the feed tube for gasifi -

switched to air (1000 mi/min) to realize the regeneration of the OCs. 
The duration for both the gasification and oxidation stages is set at 30 
min. In the biochar CLG experiment, to maintain a consistent oxygen-to-

into a reduction stage (40 mL/min H2 160 mL/min N2) and an

the introduction of H2 or H2O atmosphere, and the OC is then cooled to 
room temperature under an inert atmosphere (N2) and extracted for

Finally, the operating conditions for the biomass CLG are optimized. 
The effects of temperature (750-950 ℃), steam concentration (0–40 %), 
and oxygen-to-fuel ratio (0–0.4) on the performance of CF OC are 
investigated. It is noteworthy that during the optimization of the reac-
tion conditions, the fluidizing gas and the mass of the OC are maintained 
at 1000 mL/min and 7.03 g, respectively. Variations in steam concen -

V., Netherlands), with the results shown in Fig. 2(a). It is evident that the 
fresh F OC primarily consists of Fe2O3 with no impurity phases detected. 
With the introduction of Ca element, the characteristic peak of Fe2O3 
disappears, and the crystal phase of the CF2 OC undergoes a complete 
transformation into the spinel structure (CaFe 2O4). For the Ca:Fe ratio of 
1:1, the dominant phase is brownmillerite (Ca2Fe2O5), which is 
composed of Zweier single-chains of BO4 tetrahedra and alternating 
layers of corner-sharing BO6 octahedra [47]. This phase exhibits ordered 
oxygen vacancies and catalytic activity. However, due to the excessive 
proportion of Ca element addition, the C2F OC reveals the presence of 
two crystal phases, composed of CaO and Ca2Fe2O5.
The environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM, Quanta 
200, FEI, Netherlands) images of the fresh OCs formed with different Fe/ 
Ca ratios are shown in Fig. 2(b). The surface of the fresh F OC consists of 
uniformly distributed small crystalline grains. Upon the addition of Ca 
element, the gaps between the grains on the OC surfaces increase, 
especially for the CF OC. Nevertheless, excessive addition of Ca element 
disrupts the structural integrity and the formation of sizable voids in the 
C2F OC, consequently resulting in decreased mechanical strength. The

without any agglomeration or segregation phenomena. The Brunauer- 
Emmett-Teller (BET, ASAP2460, Micromeritics, USA) surface area 
analysis results are shown in Fig. 2(c). The addition of Ca element en-
larges the gaps between the grains, resulting in a substantial increase in 
the specific surface area. Specifically, the specific surface area rises from 
0.41 for the F OC to 1.73 for the C2F OC, enhancing by approximately 
4.22 times.
The chemical states of the four fresh OCs are investigated using X-ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Axis-Ultra DLD-600 W, Shimadzu- 
Kratos, Japan), as depicted in Fig. 2(d)-(f). The O1s XPS spectra can 
be decomposed into multiple peaks, including bulk lattice oxygen (OI: 
529–530 eV), surface absorbed oxygen (OII: 531.4 eV), and surface 
hydroxyl or carbonate (OIII: 533.2 eV) [47,48] . As the Ca:Fe ratio in-
creases, the peak area corresponding to OI decreases, while the peak 
area associated with OII increases. These results indicate that Ca doping 
reduces lattice oxygen concentration, regulates the reactivity of Fe- 
based OCs. The OII content is closely related to the microstructural P.

area contribute to an enhancement of the content of surface absorbed 
oxygen. Additionally, Ca exhibits a higher thermodynamic propensity 
than Fe to form carbonates and hydroxides by reacting with CO2 and 
H2O, resulting in a slight increase in the OIII content [49]. The Fe 2p and 
Ca 2p XPS spectrum exhibit two distinct peaks, with the lower binding 
energy peak attributable to Fe 2p3/2 and Ca 2p3/2, and the higher binding 
energy peak attributable to Fe 2p1/2 and Ca 2p3/2 [4,50,51] . With the 
addition of Ca element, the Fe 2p3/2 peak shifts towards lower binding 
energy, while the Ca 2p peak shifts towards higher binding energy, 
indicating the electron transfer from Ca to Fe [51]. Generally, the 
decrease in binding energy implies a decline in the activity of iron cat-
ions, which hinders the migration of lattice oxygen [52].
The redox stability of the OC is further characterized by TGA ex-
periments, as shown in Fig. 3. During 50 cycles, four OCs exhibit stable 
reaction activity, with the weight loss remaining consistent, and no 
deactivation of the OCs is observed. As anticipated, the F OC shows the 
highest weight loss, averaging 6.37 wt% over multiple cycles, followed 
by CF2, CF, and C2F OCs, with weight losses of 5.47 wt%, 2.64 wt%, and 
2.32 wt%, respectively. The magnitude of weight loss corresponds to the 
reaction activity of the OCs, and the addition of Ca element reduces the 
redox capability of the OCs, thereby decreasing the consumption of 
synthesis gas and contributing to an improvement in syngas yield and 
selectivity. The morphology of the OCs after 50",420,[0.04670479 0.03507603 0.02001828 ... 0.01154066 0.01844609 0.01112729]

Fig. S2. While the weight loss of different OCs remains stable throughout 
the cycling process, the F OC exhibits the most severe sintering phe-
nomenon. In comparison, increasing the Ca:Fe ratio significantly alle-
viates the sintering and agglomeration, particularly for CF and C2F OCs. 
This observation suggests that the addition of Ca element enhances the 
OC’s anti-sintering ability, thus prolonging their operational lifespan 
[45].
3.2. Effect on biomass CLG
Fig. 4shows the gas composition of four OCs in the biomass CLG process. For the F OC, the syngas predominantly consists of CO2, 
reaching 42.32 %, with relatively lower levels of CO, H2, and CH4 at 
25.83 %, 23.13 %, and 8.42 %, respectively, and almost no CmHn. In 
comparison to CF2 OC and CF OC, Fe2O3 exhibits higher reactivity and 
its more active lattice oxygen consumes biomass pyrolysis/gasification 
products, resulting in the highest CO2 concentration and the lowest H2 
concentration. These findings are consistent with the TGA results shown 
in Fig. 3. As the Ca element addition ratio increases, the lattice oxygen 
content per unit mass of OC decreases, leading to a declining trend in 
CO2 concentration and an ascending trend in H2 concentration in the 
syngas. Particularly for CF OC, the H2 concentration reaches as high as 
50 %. Further increases in the Ca:Fe ratio no substantial alteration in the 
syngas composition. Surprisingly, increasing the Ca element addition 
ratio also effectively reduces the CH4 concentration, reaching only 4.63 
% in the C2F OC. The enhancement of catalytic activity and selective 
oxidation capability of Fe-based OC by Ca elemen",408,[0.05090515 0.02896026 0.0314818  ... 0.01556614 0.01159034 0.00813883]

reason behind this phenomenon [30–32].
As shown in Table 2, with the increase of Ca element addition ratio, 
the total syngas yield experiences a rapid increase from 1.07 Nm3/kg for 
the F OC to 1.71 Nm3/kg for the CF OC. Similarly, the syngas selectivity, 
H2/CO ratio, lower heating value, and cold gas efficiency exhibit similar 
trends, reaching 71.54 %, 2.96, 9.22 MJ/Nm3, and 87.89 % respectively 
at CF OC. Continuing to increase the Ca element addition ratio, the 
variations in these indicators become negligible. Considering the 
application scenarios for syngas, the CF2 OC is capable of producing 
syngas with an H2/CO ratio close to 2, making it suitable for Fischer- 
Tropsch synthesis [33]. The CF OC and C2F OC generate hydrogen- 
rich syngas with an H2/CO ratio close to 3, which can be utilized for 
CH4 chemical synthesis [53].
3.3. Effect on biochar CLG
It is well known that the gasification reaction of biochar is the rate- 
limiting step in the CLG process, and the conversion of biochar by 
different Ca/Fe-based OCs deserves further investigation. The instanta -
neous gas concentration curves of biochar CLG are shown in Fig. 5. In 
comparison to biomass, gasification products from biochar contain 
almost no CH4 and CmHn due to the prior removal of volatile matter. 
Chen et al. [54]discovered that the solid –solid reaction rate between the 
oxygen carrier and char was significantly lower compared to the 
gas–solid reaction between steam and char. Consequently, it was 
generally accepted that biochar preferentially reacted with steam, 
yielding H2 and CO as primary products, which subsequently reacted

the gasification products (H2 and CO) of biochar, resulting in a lower 
peak value of H2 concentration (5.01 %) and a higher peak value of CO2

reduces the consumption of H2, and the peak value of H2 concentration

[30]. The crystal phase of the re-CF2 OC undergoes decomposition, 
transitioning from CaFe 2O4 to Fe3O4, CaFe 3O5 and Ca2Fe2O5. 
Conversely, the phase composition of the re-CF and re-C2F OCs remains

This observation suggests that these two OCs possess good catalytic ef-
fects. Combined with Fig. 7(c), it can be inferred that the presence of 
Ca2Fe2O5 in the re-CF2 OC and re-CF OC contributes to its higher cat-
alytic activity.
3.4.2. Catalytic effect of re-OCs on WGS reaction
Numerous studies have demonstrated that oxygen carriers possess 
the ability to catalyze the WGS reaction, leading to enhanced H2 yield 
and the regulation of syngas composition [32,33] . Fig. 8shows the 
catalytic effect of re-OCs on the WGS reaction. Since the WGS reaction is 
exothermic, the theoretical equilibrium decreases with increasing tem-
perature. The CO conversion of the four OCs is lower than the theoretical 
equilibrium, attributed to insufficient CO-steam contact and limited 
reaction time in the fixed-bed reactor. Interestingly, the catalytic ac-
tivity of the re-F OC increases as the reaction temperature rises, and the 
CO conversion increases from 37.11 % at 650 ℃ to 58.09 % at 950 ℃. 
The addition of Ca element significantly adjusts the catalytic perfor -
mance of OCs, and the CO conversion of the re-CF OC reaches the 
maximum at the same temperature. However, excessive Ca element 
addition leads to a decline in catalytic ability of the re-C2F OC. Based on 
the CO conversion results, the catalytic performance of different OCs in 
promoting the WGS reaction can be ranked as follows: CF FCF2 FC2F

The steam-iron reaction plays a pivotal role in the regulation of 
syngas quality [30]. Fig. 9shows the H2 production rate and H2 yield of 
dre-OCs. As illustrated in Fig. 9(a), it can be observed that the peak value 
of the H2 production rate increases from 1.95 mL/min for dre-F OC to 
2.90 mL/min for dre-CF OC with the escalating Ca element addition 
ratio. This suggests that dre-CF OC exhibits a notable advantage in 
hydrogen production rate. However, as the Ca element addition ratio 
continues to increase, the content of active components (Fe element) in 
dre-C2F OC is significantly diminished, which hampers the steam-iron 
reaction. Consequently, the peak value of the H2 production rate dem-
onstrates a downward trend. It is noteworthy that the duration of the 
steam-iron reaction decreases with the augmentation of the Ca element 
addition ratio. This reduction can be attributed to the fact that the Ca/Fe 
interaction significantly accelerates the rate of the steam-iron and 
shortens the reaction time. Secondly, the addition of Ca element also 
reduces the Fe content, diminishing the substances involved in the 
steam-iron reaction.
As shown in Fig. 9(b), dre-F OC has the largest H2 yield, reaching 
340.28 mL/g. With the addition of Ca element, the H2 yield experiences 
a continuous decrease, resulting in a mere 199.74 mL/g when dre-C2F 
OC is used. To compare the hydrogen production capacity of these OCs under the same standard, the H2 yield based on per mass of Fe2O3 is 
also calculated for each OC. It is evident that the H2 y",382,"[ 0.04053783  0.01596679  0.00500765 ... -0.01787327  0.01339555

dre-CF, and dre-C2F surpasses that of dre-F at equivalent Fe2O3 con-
tent. Notably, dre-CF OC exhibits the maximum H2 yield of 448.69 mL/g 
Fe2O3. It is probably because the deep reduction of CF OC in steam at-
mosphere can be completely restored to the initial state, while F and CF 
OCs cannot be entirely regenerated [33,47] .
3.5. Comprehensive evaluation of CF OC
The CLG experiments of biomass/biochar demonstrate the notable 
advantages of CF OC, including high H2 concentration, syngas yield, and 
H2/CO ratio. Moreover, it exhibits optimal catalytic capabilities, 
rendering it highly suitable for hydrogen-rich syngas production 
through biomass CLG [55,56] .
3.5.1. Identification of redox pathway
The H2/H2O fixed bed experiments and semi in-situ XRD analysis 
results are illustrated in Fig. 10. The mass variation of the CF OC is 
calculated based on the H2 balance in the input and output reactors. 
During the reduction process, the mass of OC remains constant after 
approximately 30 min, reaching a final mass fraction of about 81.20 %, 
which is close to the theoretical complete weight loss. Upon switching to 
an H2O atmosphere, the mass of the OC rapidly increases due to the 
replenishment of lattice oxygen. After 60 min, the mass is restored to 
over 99.5 %, indicating the nearly complete regeneration of the CF OC.
Fig. 10(b) reveals that during the reduction stage (positions 2 to 3), 
the crystal phases of the CF OC primarily consist of Ca2Fe2O5, CaO, and 
Fe. No other crystal phases are observed, indicating that the reduction",400,"[ 0.03671918  0.00079129  0.02631415 ... -0.00731368 -0.00310234

Ca2Fe2O5 follows a one-step reduction reaction (Ca2Fe2O5 3H2 → 
2CaO2Fe 3H2O). At position 4, the crystal phases of the CF OC only 
exhibit CaO and Fe. As the reaction atmosphere switches to H2O, the 
Ca2Fe2O5 phase reappears in the CF OC, while no other iron oxides (Fe, 
FeO, and Fe3O4) are observed. This further implies that the oxidation 
process of Ca2Fe2O5 is a one-step oxidation reaction (2CaO2Fe 
3H2O→Ca2Fe2O5 3H2). At position 6, the crystal phase of the CF OC 
solely displays Ca2Fe2O5, this perfectly explains the experimental phe-
nomenon shown in Fig. 7(c).
3.5.2. Optimization of reaction conditions
Optimizing reaction conditions holds significant economic value for 
practical production in biomass CLG. The effect of different reaction 
parameters on the CF OC is delineated in Fig. 11. As the temperature 
increases, the H2 concentration initially ascends before declining, 
peaking at 850 ℃. This trend primarily arises due to the impeded 
advancement of the WGS reaction at elevated temperatures, aligning 
with observations from Fig. 8. The CO concentration steadily rises with 
temperature elevation, resulting in a diminishing H2/CO ratio within the

forward progress of CH4 reforming reactions (CH 4 H2O → CO 3H2), 
water gas reactions (Char H2O → CO H2), and the WGS reaction 
[53], thereby reducing the concentrations of CH4 and CO in the syngas 
while significantly enhancing the H2 concentration, total syngas yield, 
and H2/CO ratio.
The oxygen-to-fuel ratio also demonstrates a substantial impact on 
biomass CLG. with an increase in the oxygen-to-fuel ratio, more lattice 
oxygen consumes the CO and CH4 in the syngas. Simultaneously, the 
participation of more reduced CF OC in the steam-iron reaction is 
beneficial for H2 generation, resulting in an increase in H2 concentration 
and H2/CO ratio with the rising oxygen-to-fuel ratio. However, beyond 
an oxygen-to-fuel ratio of 0.2, excessive lattice oxygen also deplete H2, 
leading to a slight decrease in H2 concentration. Considering factors 
such as energy consumption (biomass chemical looping steam gasifica -
tion being an intensely endothermic process) and oxygen carrier costs, 
the optimal reaction conditions consist of a gasification temperature of 
850 •C, steam concentration of 30 %, and an oxygen-to-fuel ratio of 0.2.

1.77 Nm3/kg, surpassing the biomass CLG results obtained by Liu [32]
et al. and Tang [44] et al. using Ca/Fe-based OC. This figure also out-
performs the CLG experimental results achieved with mainstream 
composite OCs such as CuO/Fe 2O3 [8], NiFe 2O4 [11], and Mn2O3/Fe2O3 
[20]. Remarkably, the H2/CO ratio of the produced syngas remains 
consistently around 3.0, fulfilling the objective of generating high- 
quality hydrogen-rich synthesis gas in biomass CLG processes.
Fig. 13shows the specific surface area and particle size distribution 
of fresh and used OCs. It is evident that the specific surface area of the CF 
OC increases after use, reaching 1.20 m3/g by the 10th cycle. This 
expanded specific surface area provides additional active sites for redox 
reactions, thereby ensuring the excellent cyclic stability of the CF OC 
[45]. The particle size distribution results show that the median particle 
size (d50) of the CF OC decreases from 363.08 μm when fresh to 316.23 
μm after 10 cycles. Vigorous collisions within the fluidized bed may 
cause a small amount of fragmentation of the OC (see Fig. S3), resulting 
in a decrease in the d50. Tilland et al. [57] observed that the OC un-
dergoes periodic expansion and contraction during the redox process, 
which may also be one of the reasons for the fragmentation. Importantly, 
with increasing cycle numbers, both the specific surface area and particle size distribution remain stable, indicating that the performance 
of CF OC tends towards stability after a brief evolution.

pattern of the used OC is identical to that of the fresh OC, revealing only 
the presence of the Ca2Fe2O5 phase and and no other crystalline phases 
are detected. Particularly noteworthy is the absence of ash phases on the 
surface of the OC after 20 cycles, which may be attributed to the utili-
zation of a fluidized bed reactor in the experimental. In the fluidized 
state, biomass ash is not easy to deposit on the surface of OC, thus 
preventing the formation of silicate phases. From Fig. 15, compared to 
the fresh OC, the microstructure of CF undergoes changes after 10 cy-
cles, with grain rearrangement and regrowth due to chemical and 
thermal stresses, resulting in a reduction in the pore structure on the 
surface of the OC. With further cycling, the microstructure of the OC 
remains stable without significant evolution. Moreover, the EDS analysis 
reveals that Fe and Ca elements are uniformly distributed on the surface 
of the used OC, without observed segregation and aggregation. In 
summary, the various characterization results indicate that the CF OC 
exhibits stable physicochemical properties and holds potential for long- 
period operation.
3.5.4. Discussion
Multiple series of experimental studies indicate that the CF OC ex-

Conversely, the ΔG for the reactions of Ca2Fe2O5 with char/CH 4 is 
below 0, signifying spontaneity. This confirms the selective oxidation 
capability of Ca2Fe2O5 [2,32] , with the reaction sequence towards 
biomass pyrolysis/gasification products as char FCH4 FCO FH2, 
conducive to the production of hydrogen-rich syngas. In contrast, the ΔG 
for the reactions of Fe2O3 with pyrolysis products are all less than 0, 
which, from a thermodynamic perspective, hinders the generation of 
hydrogen-rich syngas. The reactivity of CaFe 2O4 falls between that of 
Fe2O3 and Ca2Fe2O5. Noteworthy is that the kinetic results obtained by 
Miller et al. [58] and Feng et al. [38] through density functional theory 
(DFT) calculations demonstrate that Ca2Fe2O5 is unfavorable for re-
actions with CO and H2, and tending to react with char to produce CO 
and H2, aligning with the results in Fig. S4. However, there is a lack of 
DFT analysis on various Ca/Fe-based OCs currently, warranting further 
detailed investigation.
In recent decades, research on Fe-based oxides catalyzing the WGS 
reaction has attracted significant attention [41,59,60] . Scholars have

In this work, four Ca/Fe-based oxygen carriers (OCs) are synthesized 
using the sol–gel method, which are applied in the biomass/biochar CLG 
experiments. The regulation mechanism of these OCs is studied in de-
tails. The main findings are summarized as follows:
(1) The Ca2Fe2O5 (abbreviated as CF) OC exhibits remarkable 
biochar-gasification enhancement characteristics in biomass/ 
biochar CLG experiments. Generally, the addition of Ca element 
moderately reduces the reactivity of Fe2O3, consequently 
enhancing the selective oxidation ability of the OCs and pro-
moting the production of hydrogen-rich syngas.

alytic properties of OCs significantly influence the conversion 
rate of biochar. When",185,[0.04191596 0.03893982 0.02120789 ... 0.01847029 0.00441594 0.00315506]

(denoted as F) OC exhibits the highest instantaneous carbon 
conversion rate, while the instantaneous carbon conversion rate 
of the CaFe 2O4 (denoted as CF2) OC surpasses that of the Fe2O3 
OC as XC F0.3. XRD analysis reveals that the catalytic substance 
is Ca2Fe2O5.

wate-gas shift (WGS) reaction. The catalytic performances of 
different OCs in promoting the WGS reaction follows the order: 
CFFCF2 FC2F FF, where C2F is with the Ca:Fe molar ratio of 
2:1.
(4) In the steam-iron reaction experiment, the addition of Ca element 
reduces the H2 yield from 340.28 mL/g (dre-F OC) to 199.74 mL/

that both reduction and oxidation reactions of Ca2Fe2O5 are

temperatures (T) and the molar ratio of V2O3 to CH4 (nV2O3/nCH 4) are performed in details. The results show that 
the above parameters have a significant effect on OW-CLG process. The optimal methane conversion rate of 44.9 
% is obtained at oxygen excess ratio, temperature, and mV2O3/mcorn stalk of 0.2, 700℃, and 2.16 respectively. The 
highest H2 yield is 2.05 l with 1g corn stalk and 20ml ethanol model solution. The reaction kinetics and the 
thermodynamics were analyzed, verifying that the introduction of ethanol liquid waste and V2O3 could boost 
hydrogen generation. The corn stalk OW-CLG is an endothermic process with the total endothermic heat of 
5.396 kJ/mol. The thermodynamically feasible temperature range for the partial oxidation of CH4 to hydrogen 
by V2O3 is above 950K. V2O3 OC during OW-CLG is regenerated by the reaction of VC and CO2.

concluded to be more feasible, sustainable, environment-friendly and 
likely to become competitive with the conventional natural gas 
reforming method (Udomsirichakorn and Salam, 2014 ). Biomass CLG 
may play an important role for renewable hydrogen production in near 
future. 
The waste generation as the second major challenge to our society is 
expected to jump to 3.4 billion tonnes over the next 30 years by 2050 
(Kaza et al., 2018 ). The waste streams contain a variety of material or 
compound with energetic or economic value. Driven by brewing and 
distilling industry, large amount of distillery wastewater also termed 
stillage, pot ale, slops, or spent wash is produced in fermentation and 
downstream processes (Song et al., 2020 ). The distillery wastewater 
consists of unconvertible organic fractions and high percentage of dis-
solved organic and inorganic matters with up to 140g/l chemical oxy-
gen demand and 65g/l biochemical oxygen demand (Ghosh Ray and 
Ghangrekar, 2019b ). In some cases, ethanol constitutes up to 90 % of the 
COD content in winery wastewater (Rodriguez-Caballero et al., 2012 ).

methanation production. However, the high chemical stability of phe-
nols, melanoidins, sugar decomposition products of microbial 
metabolism can be toxic or inhibitory to anaerobic treatment (Phuong 
and le, Besson, 2019 ). Therefore, the physico-chemical techniques such 
as adsorption, nanofiltration, reverse osmosis, flocculation, and oxida -
tion have been also applied for the treatment of the distillery effluents 
(Ratna et al., 2021 ). The coupling of the energy intensive CLG and 
various physico-chemical and biological methods is one of the promising 
options for distillery wastewater management and value-added com-
pound production. The supercritical water gasification was used to 
completely remove the pre-drying requirement during H2 production 
with empty fruit bunch and palm oil effluent (Ajiwibowo et al., 2019 ). 
The syngas composition of chemical looping reforming process with 
waste cooking oil was determined as a function of reforming tempera -
ture (400 –1000•C) (Faleh et al., 2016 ). 41kg/h methanol could be

In this vein, we propose the organic waste chemical looping gasifi -
cation (OW-CLG) scheme for hydrogen production with the biomass and 
concentrated distillery wastewater as feedstock. 5% ethanol-containing 
wastewater was employed for chemical looping reforming using iron- 
based OC (Qin et al., 2018 ). It was found that the organic solution 
(methanol solution) can significantly improve the H2/CO ratio and ηC in 
the gasification process compared to water (Qin et al., 2019a, 2019b ). 
The heat released from the OC oxidation can meet heat demand for 
ethanol reforming reaction, making the whole process exothermic. The 
organic liquid waste was introduced to activate OC and provide gasifi -
cation agent of CLG for H2 production (Zheng et al., 2020a ). The 
simultaneous modification of Fe2O3/Al2O3 and supplement of oxidant 
for biomass CLG by introducing KNO 3 containing ethanol liquid waste 
indicated that the alkaline organic liquid waste could boost solid fuel 
gasification (Qin et al., 2021 ). It was found that methane accounted for 
the composition of syngas up to 11.2 % (Zheng et al., 2020b ). Although 
12.5% CH4 addition as diluent in syngas results in no change in CO

reforming of syngas is necessary for the sake of high yield hydrogen 
production. Methane feedstock is consumed to provide heat for the 
conventional steam reforming of natural gas, leading to only 76% yield 
of product energy (Krenzke et al., 2017 ). The chemical looping 
reforming (CLR) of methane via metal oxide redox cycle is a promising 
approach to hydrogen production (Chuayboon et al., 2020 ). Various 
metal oxides including CeO 2, Fe2TiO5, Ni-Fe xOy, LaFeO 3, Pt-V 2O3 are 
particularly attractive candidate due to their physical and chemical 
properties (shown in Table 1). Compared with other oxygen carrier, 
V2O3 and CeO 2 have the comparable high selectivity to CO. But CeO 2 
catalysis activity of methane conversion is only 40–55 % (850 ℃), while 
Fe2TiO5, Ni-Fe xOy, LaFeO 3 have the low lattice O release capacity of

CO2 oxidation regeneration, high lattice oxygen storage capacity, redox

Pt-V 2O3 during cycling reached 81.7 % (Ge et al., 2020a ). 
In this regard, OW-CLG and CLR are combined in this work to pro-
duce hydrogen with corn stalks and distillery wastewater (shown in  
Fig. 1). The ethanol solution is used as model distillery wastewater to 
provide sufficient steam and organic compound. V2O3 is employed as 
CLR metal oxide to reform CH4 into H2 and CO. The reduced V2O3 can be 
regenerated by CO2 separated from the syngas. 
To this end, Hydrogen production by organic waste chemical looping

2.Methods 
2.1. Materials 
The corn stalks and ethanol solution (6% volume fraction) were used 
as the feedstocks for OW-CLG system. OC of the Fe2O3/Al2O3 containing 
40wt% Al2O3 and 60wt% Fe2O3 was prepared by the impregnation 
method (Ad˘anez-Rubio et al., 2018 ). Al2O3 powder was added to satu-
rated Fe(NO 3)3 solution. The mixture was stirred at 70•C until it 
become paste. After drying at 100•C, the mixture was then calcined in 
the muffle furnace for 1.5h at 900•C. The prepared Fe2O3/Al2O3 was ground into 60–80 mesh OC powder. The proximate analysis and ulti-
mate analysis of the corn stalk were conducted (shown in Table 2). The 
molecular formula could be determined as C1.7H3O.

3.Results and discussion 
3.1. Gasification reaction characteristics under various mass ratio of 
V2O3 to corn stalk 
The reduction mechanism of Fe2O3 during gasification is very 
complicated. Normally it undergoes a sequential pathway for the vari-
ation in oxidation of state from “3∕∕to 0. The H2 production was 
enhanced by adding waste liquid vapor into reaction system at Ω of 0.2 
as in R6 (Fan, 2010; Kale et al., 2013 ). CO is easily oxidized by OC (R9), 
and water –gas shift reaction (R10) is the equilibrium-limited reaction at 
higher temperatures (Prasad and Kuester, 1988 ). Therefore, CO remains at a low level during gasification. When ΩF0.2, the rate of R8 is higher 
than that of hydrogen production reaction, resulting in a decrease in 
hydrogen production (More and Veser, 2017; Zeng et al., 2016 ). 
Therefore, the effect of various mV2O3/mcorn stalk (ranging from 0 to 4.32) 
on OW-CLG was investigated at Ω and temperature of 0.2",286,"[ 0.02389609  0.02770235 -0.01729707 ...  0.02448167  0.01891868

The total volume and real flow rates of various outlet gas are shown in  
Fig. 3. The highest CH4 conversion rate of 49.2 % was observed at 
mV2O3/mcorn stalk of 4.32 (shown in Fig. 3f). The plausible explanation 
may reside in that high mV2O3/mcorn stalk is conducive to CH4 reforming 
reaction (R12), promoting the decomposition of CH4 (Ge et al., 2020b ). 
The flow rate of H2 increased significantly in the initial stage due to 
steam reforming reaction (R2~R6) (de Vos et al., 2019; Kale et al., 
2013 ). The outlet gas is mainly composed of CO2 and H2 within the first 
30min of the reaction, as well as a certain amount of CH4 produced by 
the pyrolysis of biomass and ethanol (R1).

Compared with the control, CH4 conversion (R12) was favored with 
increasing mV2O3/mcorn stalk, which is beneficial for H2 production. CO 
content of the outlet gas is low even CH4 is decomposed in this work, 
which is consistent with the previous result (Prasad and Kuester, 1988 ).

at R3, R10, R11 (Al-Zareer et al., 2018; Qin et al., 2015; Shen et al.,

oxidation state of the reduced OC is also more efficient than the OC 
consumption process (Inayat et al., 2010 ), such as R6 (Huang et al., 
2017b ), making the H2 production rate higher than H2 consumption 
rate. In addition, since R11 is an endothermic reaction (Zaini et al., 
2017 ), methane reforming to produce more H2 is conducive at high 
temperature. The activity of the V2O3 is low at 600℃, leading to low 
CH4 conversion rate. When the temperature increased to 800℃, the 
hydrogen production is further enhanced. What should be mentioned is 
the CH4 conversion rate tends to decrease",232,"[ 0.02418132 -0.03187941  0.0075428  ... -0.0016999   0.02409258

crease and subsequent decrease of rc was mainly caused by the reactions 
R2-R4 and the depletion of water vapor (Guo et al., 2015 ). In the first 
35min, the production of syngas or hydrogen is mainly the result of 
steam reforming and ethanol decomposition reactions (R2-R4, R6) 
(Najera et al., 2011 ), rather than the direct partial oxidation of corn 
stalks by lattice oxygen. The remaining fixed carbon hardly contributes 
to conversion to syngas.

The thermodynamic properties of V2O3 in the catalytic reforming of 
CH4 can be evaluated by the ΔG versus temperature. Since vanadium has 
various oxidation states, such as redox pairs such as V2O5-VO 2, V2O5- 
V2O3, V2O5-VO, V2O5-V2O3, V2O3-VO, VO-V, V2O3-VC, and VO-VC, it 
can be predicted from Fig. 7 the possible pathways of V2O3 during the 
preparation and redox reactions process. Fig. 8 shows the thermody -
namic possibility of reducing V2O5 to V2O3 using H2 during V2O3 
preparation (R17), but the reduced V2O3 cannot be regenerated at high 
temperature in the presence of air because the reduced V2O3 may be 
oxidized to V2O5 and lose the ability to catalyze CH4 reforming to pro-
duce hydrogen (R19). The excellent catalytic performance of V2O3 for 
methane reforming has been demonstrated (Ge et al., 2020b ). The 
thermodynamically feasible temperature range for the partial oxidation 
of CH4 to hydrogen by V2O3 (R20) is above 950K, which explains the 
low CH4 conversion at low temperature (600•C). The reduced V2O3 can 
be oxidized and regenerated into V2O3 by CO at 750–1500 K, which 
confirms the low CO content in the syngas after adding V2O3. And the 
excess V2O3 will not further oxidize CO to CO2. The R27-R30 reactions 
are thermodynamically",601,"[ 0.02131726 -0.00707719  0.0051294  ...  0.01559382  0.01286347

(28) and (29) show that H2O and CO2 components account for a large 
proportion in the corresponding reactions at 1000 K, indicating that 
V2O3 is difficult to react with H2O and CO2, and V2O3 mainly partially 
oxidizes CH4. However, at 1000 K, it is thermodynamically feasible for 
V2O3 to oxidize H2 to generate H2O. Therefore, excessive addition of 
V2O3 may lead to the oxidation of H2, resulting in a decrease in H2 
production. In addition, the reaction of V2O3 and VO with CH4 is ther-
modynamically feasible in 800–1000•C, while the reduction of VO to 
elemental vanadium can only proceed above 1200•C. The sum of the 
reaction R20 and R23 is equal to the reaction R12, so V2O3-VC is the 
overall redox pair of the V2O3 OC in 950–1300 K. The regeneration 
process of V2O3 OC during OW-CLG proceeds through reaction R26.

Analysis of the OW-CLG thermal conversion process is crucial for 
evaluating whether the system can operate stably. the corn stalk OW- 
CLG can obtain higher H2 yield and CH4 conversion rate at tempera -
ture, mV2O3/mcorn stalk and Ω of 700℃, 2.16, and 0.2. Therefore, under 
this optimal reaction condition, the thermodynamic analysis of the OW- 
CLG process is carried out. Based on the electron balance, the average 
valence of iron after reduction is 2.02, the molecular formula of reduced 
iron oxide can be approximated as Fe2O2.02 (Ge et al., 2",519,"[ 0.01564183  0.02208042 -0.00463541 ...  0.01550667  0.01575242

(R31) 
According to the thermodynamic parameters in Table 3, the enthalpy 
of the R31 can be calculated, ΔHmol 1049.391 kJ/mol. The corn stalk 
OW-CLG is an endothermic process, and the total endothermic heat is 
4.237 kJ. 0.021 molH2O is evaporated, and the heat absorbed by 
evaporation is 0.903 kJ, while 0.006 mol ethanol is evaporated, and the 
heat absorbed by evaporation is 0.256 kJ. During this process, OC can 
not only transfer lattice oxygen but also act as a heat carrier (Qin et al., 
2019a, 2019b ) to transfer the heat between FR and AR. In the AR, the OC 
oxidation regeneration process equation is as follows:

Fe 0B75O2→0B5Fe2O3ΔH mol 753B739kJEmol (R33) 
According to the calculation results, the corn stalk OW-CLG process 
needs to absorb 5.396 kJ of heat. In the AR, the oxidation reaction of the 
reduced OC releases 2.913 kJ of heat. The heat released by the oxidation 
of the reduced OC can’t meet the heat required for the corn stalk OW- 
CLG process, which means that external supplementary heat is 
required to maintain the entire corn stalk OW-CLG process.

performed previously via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray

there is no A12O3 diffraction peak, indicating that the prepared OC has 
high crystallinity and Fe2O3 has good coverage on the surface of A12O3 
(Luo et al., 2021; Zheng et al., 2020a ). The SEM image shows that the 
fresh oxygen carrier has smooth surface and good porosity, which is 
conducive to the gasification intermediate product to penetrate into the 
OC particles and improve its reaction activity. In addition, the good 
cycle characteristic of OCs based on Fe2O3 have been verified (Qin et al., 
2019a and 2019b, 2015 ). 
As shown in Fig. 9, the surface particles of fresh V2O3-based OC are 
evenly distributed and have high porosity, which is conducive to the 
penetration of gasification intermediate products into the interior of the 
V2O3-based OC particles. After reduction at 700•C, the uniform surface Table 3

Nowadays, hydrogen production from steam reforming biomass

E:\\PINNs-Research\\Searched Articles\\Hydrogen production from chemical looping steam reforming of glycerol by Ni based Al-MCM-41 oxygen carriers in a fixed-bed reactor.pdf,2,1,"overcome this problem, researchers proposed a chemical looping
reforming (CLR) progress, in which the catalyst is continuously
regenerated by air [1,2] . This is achieved by circulating the oxygen
carrier (OC) between a reformer, in which the OC contacts with
fuel, and a regenerator, in which the OC and coke deposited are
oxidized by air [3]. We recently demonstrated renewable H 2
generation from glycerol via CLR, which was carried out by Ni-
based OCs [4]. The autothermal and continuous hydrogen produc-
tion by CLR in a moving-bed reactor has been investigated in our
previous study [5]. The OC in CLR performs a bifunctional material:
(1) oxygen transfer medium during redox cycle and (2) steam
reforming catalyst in its reduced state. Hence, an excellent OC
should be a unique combination of high catalytic activity and
splendid redox property.
Previously, researches have focused on different OCs including
Mn, Ni, Cu and Fe-based OCs, and concluded that Ni-based OCs
may present high reactivity and stability at harsh reaction condi-
tions [6]. However, the major barrier for Ni based OCs is the rapid
deactivation caused by coke deposition and metal sintering [7].I ti s
signiﬁcant that coke formation on Ni-based OCs strongly depends
on the availability of lattice oxygen. A feasible strategy to solve this
problem is to add the promoter. It has been reported that CeO 2has
remarkable redox reactions and oxygen storage-release capability
by altering state between Ce3+and Ce4+[8]. Moreover, the incorpo-
ration of Ce could strengthen the metal-support interaction (MSI)
and promote Ni distribution [9]. It is also remarkable that Ni-
CeO 2system shows low methanation activity and high water gas
shift (WGS) activity, which is crucial to achieve high selectivity
to H 2in fuel feed step [10]. In addition, an effective approach to
improve the Ni disper",441,"[ 0.04539463 -0.01515781  0.00898435 ... -0.01767974 -0.01318099

nanoparticles is to accommodate them in porous supports, such
as porous silica or alumina. Recently, the preparation of
mesoporous materials that are derived from various types of natu-
ral layered silicates, such as montmorillonite, has been emphasized
because of the abundance of the starting material and the similar-
ity of the natural material’s structure units to those of mesoporous
material. Encapsulation of inorganic species into these
aluminosilicate-mesoporous materials can potentially be used as
OCs in CLR. Two approaches, direct-synthesis and post-synthesis
method, have been developed to prepare these hybrid ordered
mesoporous materials. Both approaches have pros and cons [11].
Considering above strategies, it is expected to develop a Ce pro-
moted Ni based Al-MCM-41 OC for hydrogen generation in CLR. As
the OCs synthesized by different methods show different charac-
teristics, it is signiﬁcant to investigate the effect of synthesis
method on the CLR activity and stability.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of OCs
The Al-MCM-41 was synthesized as following steps. Montmo-
rillonite (Aldrich) of 10.0 g was ﬁrst mixed with 15.0 g NaOH at
600/C176C for 2 h, followed by being dispersed in 400 mL deionized
water and aged for 16 h at room temperature. The supernatant
was employed as Al and Si source in the following steps. Deionized
water (50 mL) was used to dissolve 1.0 g CTAB and 1.0 g PEG4000,
and then supernatant (Al and Si source) of 80 mL was added into
above aforesaid solution under stirring. The mixture was continu-
ously stirred for 1 h at 30 /C176C. An HCl solution (2 M) was added into
the mixture to adjust the pH value to 9. The mixture was vigor-
ously stirred for 1 h at 30 /C176C, and then transferred into the
Teﬂon-lined steel autoclave. The sample was heated at 110 /C176C for
24 h",488,"[ 0.03034691 -0.0247866   0.02132686 ... -0.0219941  -0.03415263

The resultant wasﬁltered, washed and dried at 80 /C176C for 12 h, and then calcined at
a heating rate of 5 /C176C/min to 650 /C176C for 3 h.
CeNi/Al-MCM-41 and Ni/Al-MCM-41 oxygen carrier was pre-
pared by the direct-synthesis method on the basis of Ref. [12] with
modiﬁcations. The Ni loading was ﬁxed to about 7 wt% for the both
samples. The Ce loading was set to about 1 wt% in the sample of
CeNi/Al-MCM-41. The synthetic routine was similar to the synthe-
sis of the Al-MCM-41. The difference is that Ni(NO 3)3/C16H2O (Ce
(NO 3)3/C16H2O and Ni(NO 3)3/C16H2O) dissolved in deionized water
with CTAB and PEG4000 was added into the Al and Si source
supernatant.
Ni@Al-MCM-41 was prepared by a surfactant-assisted isovolu-
metric wetness impregnation method (post-synthesis method).
The Ni loading was also ﬁxed to about 7 wt% in this sample. The
as-prepared Al-MCM-41 was immersed into Ni(NO 3)3/C16H2O solu-
tion with the help of CTAB. The resultant was further sonicated
for 0.5 h and then dried at 80 /C176C overnight. Finally, the powder
was calcined at 650 /C176C for 4 h at a heating rate of 5 /C176C/min.
2.2. Characterization and activity tests
XRD (Shimadzu XRD-600) was applied to determine crystalline
phase in the samples and identify the mesoporous structure using
graphite ﬁltered Cu K aradiation ( k= 0.15406 nm). ICP-OES
(VISTA-PROAX spectrophotometer) was used to determine the
actual elemental content of the metals. N 2adsorption-desorption
analysis (Micromeritics ASAP 2020 Sorptometer) was performed
at 77 K and the pore size distributions and the cumulative pore vol-
umes were obtained from desorption branches of the isotherms by
Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. Morphology of the OCs was
obtained by a HRTEM (TECNAI G2 F20) equipped with an energy
dispersion X-ray spectrometer (EDS). H 2-TPR was con",588,"[ 0.03309981 -0.02974618 -0.00102934 ... -0.03098657 -0.01352935

Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 instrument so as to analyse
metal-support interaction. As testing of OCs in a continuous unit
does not allow for the detail resolution of the reduction and oxida-
tion properties of the materials [3]. The activity and stability tests
of OCs in CLR of glycerol were evaluated in a down-ﬂow ﬁxed-bed
reactor (diameter 12 mm) operating at 650 /C176C and ambient pres-
sure. The experimental methods and relevant calculations have
been reported in our previous studies [4,13] .
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of fresh and spent OCs
The N 2adsorption-desorption isotherms of fresh OCs are illus-
trated in Fig. 1 (a). All the samples exhibited typical IV behavior
with an H1 type hysteresis loop, which is a typical characteristic
for mesoporous materials with two-dimensional hexagonal struc-
tures. The pore size distribution shown in Fig. 1 (b) reveals that
CeNi/Al-MCM-41 and Ni/Al-MCM-41 have narrower pore size dis-
tribution range, and Ni@Al-MCM-41 loses the uniform pore size
distribution indicating that the NiO nanoparticles encapsulated in
Ni@Al-MCM-41 may enhance the roughness of the pore wall
and/or partially block the mesopores of the matrix. The textural
properties of the samples are listed in Table 1 . It is pronounced that
the incorporation of the active phase has remarkable impact on
physical properties of Al-MCM-41, as obvious decrease in the
speciﬁc surface area and pore volume. The Ni@Al-MCM-41 derived
from post-synthesis method possessed smaller surface area and
pore volume, compared with Ni/Al-MCM-41 derived from direct-
synthesis method. This is mainly due to Ni precursors deposition
on the support in the form of a ﬁnely dispersed layer in the post
synthesis method, which could block the entrance or/and exit of
some mesopores [14].B. Jiang et al. / Fuel 183 (2016) 170–176",480,"[ 0.01199441  0.0138082   0.00537635 ... -0.01285254 -0.00856186

CeO 2is observed, revealing that CeO 2is either amorphous or well
dispersed in the OC. The NiO reﬂection of CeNi/Al-MCM-41 was
very weak along with the line broadening, which is responsible
for the smaller NiO nanoparticle size in the presence of CeO 2.Gonzalez-DelaCruz et al. [15] have demonstrated that Ni could

the stronger interaction with silica matrix for the three NiO spe-
cies. The lower reducibility extent is due to the better conﬁnement
effect of the direct-synthesis method. On the other hand, the
domains of integration related to the H 2consumption of the sec-
ond and third reduction peaks were larger. It can be suggested that
most of the Ni ions is either highly dispersed in the interior of the
silica wall or incorporated into the silica framework. After the
introduction of the second metal Ce, some changes occurred in
the TPR proﬁles. A broad peak in the range from 400 /C176C to 750 /C176C
was observed. It could be divided into two peaks by deconvolution.
Thus, there actually are three NiO peaks in CeNi/Al-MCM-41. The
intensity of the ﬁrst reduction peak (380 /C176C) is inconspicuous,
while the latter two (400–700 /C176C) show high intensity. This indi-
cates few NiO is adsorbed on the external surface and the decrease
of reducibility of NiO on the internal surface and subsurface in the
presence of Ce is due to the metal synergistic effect [18].

particle might be derived from: (1) the aggregation of some NiO
from the destroyed framework; (2) small NiO nanoparticles
migrated out of internal surface because of relative weak metal-
support interaction during the air feed step [20].
3.2. Activity and stability tests of OCs
As shown in Fig. 3 , it is signiﬁcant that H
2production is delayed
for all OCs. It could be attributed to the reduction of NiO to Ni at
the initial stage of fuel feed step. In other words, the steam reform-
ing reaction would not completely occur until NiO is converted
into Ni at the maximum extent ( Fig. 3 (a), (e) and (h)). At the ‘dead
time’, a signiﬁcant negative steam conversion occurred for all of
the OCs. This is caused by the H 2O formation in this period [4].I t
is a further evidence of the NiO reduction by fuel. Upon up-
scaling process, the ‘dead time’ would cause exaggerated intermit-
tency in H 2generation. It is worthy of nothing that the ‘dead time’
decreases in the following sequence: Ni@Al-MCM-41, Ni/Al-MCM-
41 and CeNi/A",296,"[ 2.3764690e-02  1.5017511e-02  1.0534745e-03 ...  6.8765081e-04

sidering the proposed reaction mechanism of ‘dead time’ [21],w e
have reason to believe that the duration of the ‘dead time’ is closely
related to the dispersion of the active phase. Thus, we can conclude
that the direct-synthesis method and Ce promoter are conducive to
shorten the ‘dead time’. At the end of ‘dead time’, it is clearly that
all the measurement parameters change signiﬁcantly. At the

hydrogen selectivity is up to 75%. The glycerol conversion and H 2
selectivity decrease in this order: CeNi/Al-MCM-41, Ni/Al-MCM-41, and Ni@Al-MCM-41. This could be associated with active nickel
surface area, as Ni is identiﬁed as the active center for C AC and
CAH bond cleavage, which facilitates the conversion of glycerol
and C
2intermediate. The CH 4selectivity for all the OCs investi-
gated is not high, indicating that methanation is inhibited under
this reaction condition because of its extremely exothermic nature.
Since CO 2/CO ratio is considered as an indicator of WGS activity,

the promotion of WGS reaction. As shown in Fig. 3 (c), (g) and (k),

that CeNi/Al-MCM-41 exhibit smallest peak area. It indicates that
the Ce promoter could effectively suppress the coke formation in
the fuel feed step. The ﬁnal stage of air feed step was signaled by
sharp rise of O 2concentration from 0% to 23%. This suggests the
complete replenishment of OCs and elimination of coke.
As shown in Fig. 4 (a), it is signiﬁcant that the CeNi/Al-MCM-41

This would enhance the conﬁnement effect, thus effectively

effectively clean the carbon deposition from the surface of OCs.
The temperature rise and amount of CO

Ni/Al-MCM-41 increase with the proceeding of the tests. This could
be caused by the growth of Ni nanoparticles. Chen et al. [22] have
demonstrated that small Ni crystals possesses a high saturation
concentration of coke and therefore a low driving force for coke dif-
fusion through the nickel crystals. As a consequence, the gradual
sintering of Ni would exacerbate the coke deposition issue simulta-
neously. The addition of Ce improve the MSI and thus enha",188,"[ 0.0551009  -0.05095521  0.01684513 ...  0.00430968 -0.00689417

sintering resistance. So CeNi/Al-MCM-41 showed steady tempera-
ture variety and CO 2concentration at the stability test.
4. Conclusions
Three nickel nanoparticles encapsulated inside Al-MCM-41,
derived from montmorillonite, mesoporous OCs were successfully
synthesized via different synthesis method, and for the ﬁrst time
used in CLR progress. It is clear that both ordered mesoporous
structure and Ce promoter play important role in achievingexcellent CLR performance. The OCs derived from direct-
synthesis method could improve Ni loading, dispersion and MSI,
and the Ce modiﬁcation could effectively control the size of nickel
size, improve the reducibility of partial NiO species, and promote
WGS reaction. The synergistic effect of above results lead to the
high activity, good stability and short ‘dead time’.",188,"[ 0.05243784 -0.02776424  0.01735909 ... -0.03428033 -0.03144725

1.Introduction
Hydrogen  (H2) is considered as a promising candidate to replace fossil fuels in the future because of its high
efficien cy, carbon -free characteristics, high flexibility in its production and utilization, and has the potential to
solve some  environmental problems . Among many  sources  to produce H 2, biomass is receiving high attention",279,"[ 0.00733499  0.00106142  0.02697131 ... -0.01690455 -0.00646351

biomass, rice husk also has high energy potential . Every year, the total amount of produced rice husk around
the world is  about  120 Mt ( Lay et al., 2020 ). From both economic and environmental points of view, it is
nece ssary to develop an efficient conversion system of H2 from rice husks .
Darmawan et al. (2018)  proposed an integrated system of rice production and power ge neration  and achieved
an electricity production efficiency of about 32 % . Superheated steam drying (SSD) was  used to dry the paddy
in the parboiling process , which is a pretreatment process for rice grain s. SSD was selected because it  could
realize  higher drying rate , better quality , and lower net energy consumption  compared to other drying methods .
However, they only focuse d on the conversion of rice husk to power and lacked  consideration a bout the possible
conversion to H2, which is also an important aspect  for broader utilization .
The conventional H2 production method, which is steam methane reforming , is a complex process including
water gas shift and pressure swing adsorption units, maki",276,"[ 0.00390445 -0.00213256  0.03407717 ... -0.01851402 -0.0082242

Recently, chemical looping H2 production (CLH 2) technology is receiving  intensive attention due to its free -
carbon characteristics and high conversion effic iency  (Fernández and Abanades, 2016 ).
Although H 2 has advantageous characteristics, its volumetric energy density is very low (only about 3 Wh/L).
Hence, more efficient H 2 storage, both gravimetric and volumetric H 2 densities, is urgently demanded. Among
many H2 storage technologies , NH 3 is a prefe rred option because of i ts high storage capacity, applicability,
economic performance , and H2 density.  Haber -Bosch process , the main process for  NH 3 production , utilizes
purified N 2 and H 2 and reacts them under high temperature (400–550 °C) and high pressure (up to 30 MPa)
condition, which is highly energy consuming . Nurdiawati et al. (2019)  proposed an integrated syste m of CLH 2
and NH 3 synthesis by utilizing the H 2-rich gas from the oxidizer and N 2-rich gas from the combustor and achieved
a high total energy efficiency of up to 64.3 %  and showed high affinity between  CLH 2 and NH 3 synthesis.
However , this research  focused on microalgae , not the rice industry.

produced H2-rich gas  from the oxidizer is either pressurized and used to run fuel cell -based agricultural
machines (such as  forklift  and tractor) or mixed and reacted with N2-rich gas from the combustor  to produce
NH 3 through  Haber -Bosch process . In case of the latter, the produced NH3 can be utilized whether as

The conversion efficiency for the synthesis reaction is around 20 –30 %. The unreacted gas has to be recycled
so the produced gas is cooled to 25 °C (CL5) to separate NH 3 with unreacted H 2 and N 2. A part of the unreacted
gas must also leave the loop in order to avoid accumulation of substances, such as Ar, so the unreacted gas is

Chemical looping gasification provides a novel technology to enable clean conversion of coal with inherent CO2

oxygen carrier and oxygen carrier to coal (O/C) ratio on chemical looping gasification of lignite were first 
investigated by a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) combing with various analytical methods. The results show 
that, among four types of oxygen carrier, the NiFe 2O4 synthesized by sol–gel method exhibits the highest gasi-
fication reactivity with lignite char at an O/C ratio of 1, since its highly cubic spinel structure is beneficial to 
improve the mobility of lattice oxygen. Furthermore, the operating conditions for chemical looping gasification 
of lignite were optimized and the gasification performance of four types oxygen carriers was compared by using a 
fixed bed reactor. It is found that NiFe 2O4 synthesized by sol–gel method exhibits the highest total gas yield of 
24.47 mol/kg and H2/CO ratio of 0.77 during chemical looping gasification of lignite under the optimal oper-
ating conditions, ascribed to Fe-Ni synergistic effect which provided higher gasification reactivity with lignite 
char. The addition of steam drastically improves the total gas yield and H2/CO ratio of syngas from 24.47 mol/kg

1.Introduction 
With the steady population growth and economic development, the 
global energy consumption has increased gradually and is expected to 
continue to increase, especially in major emerging countries. The global 
primary energy consumption grew by 1.3% in 2019, while the primary 
energy consumption of China increased by 4.4%. China accounted for 
24.3% of global energy consumption and 77.3% of global growth [1]. 
Coal has dominated the energy consumption of China over the last half 
century. The total coal consumption of China in 2019 was about 2.804 
billion tons of standard coal equivalent (SCE), accounting for about 
57.7% of the total energy consumption. It can be foreseen that coal will 
still dominate China ’s energy consumption in the next few decades. 
However, the conventional coal-fired power plants in China usually provides high air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions. As the world ’s 
largest emitter of CO2, China has pledged to reach peak carbon dioxide

government has issued stringent environmental regulation and policy 
initiatives in order to drive the development of clean coal technologies 
to replace existing coal-fired power plants. 
Gasification is a promising technology that offers a clean and effi-
cient way to convert solid coal into syngas. Syngas from coal-
gasification, primarily consisting of H2 and CO, has been employed as a 
versatile platform for generating various desired products, such as 
electric power, heat, hydrogen, methane, methanol, dimethyl ether, 
Fischer-Tropsch (FT) liquids, and ammonia [2–4]. During gasification, 
coal is partially oxidized bygasifying agent at high temperature to form 
syngas via a series of oxidization and reforming reactions [5]. Typical

2gasifying agents used are substoichiometric oxygen, air, steam, CO2, or 
their mixtures. The desired oxygen in coal gasification is typically 20 to 
40 percent of the stoichiometric oxygen required for complete oxidation. 
The heat released by partial oxidation of coal provides the energy 
required to drive the endothermic reactions during coal gasification. 
However, conventional air gasification results in a low-quality syngas 
with low calorific value (4–8 MJ/Nm3) due to the dilution effect of ni-
trogen in theair. Pure oxygen oroxygen-enriched air gasification typi-
cally require a cryogenic air separation unit, resulting 
inhigher investment/operation costs and a sharp reduction in energy 
efficiency. Hence, a novel gasification process, namely coal chemical 
looping gasification (CCLG), has been developed for producing high- 
quality syngas from coal [6–8]. CCLG utilizes lattice oxygen within ox-
ygen carrier instead of molecular oxygen as gasifying agent [9,10] . 
During CCLG, coal is first pyrolyzed into volatiles and char, which are 
partially oxidized by the oxygen carrier to produce syngas in the fuel 
reactor. The reduced oxygen carrier is subsequently transferred from the 
fuel reactor to the air reactor where it is regenerated by air oxidization 
[11–13].The oxygen and heat required to drive endothermic gasifica -
tion reactions in the fuel reactor is supplied by circulating hot oxygen 
carrier regenerated from exothermic oxidization in the air reactor. This 
CCLG process, preventing the direct contact between coal and air, can 
avoid the need for cryogenic air separation unit to achieve a non- 
nitrogen diluted syngas, thereby eliminating the energy and cost pen-
alty associated with CO2 capture [14–16]. 
H2has been considered as a unique zero-emission energy carrier in 
future energy systems. It is generally accepted that the high H2/CO ratio 
of syngas is beneficial for its subsequent separation, combustion, or 
catalytic synthesis units [17]. Depending on the purpose of the down -
stream process, the composition of syngas needs to be adjusted prefer -
entially. The composition of syngas is highly dependent upon the nature 
of oxygen carrier and operating conditions of CCLG",515,"[-0.02211788  0.00090715  0.01660387 ... -0.00388207 -0.03167469

opment of suitable oxygen carrier and optimization of operating con-
ditions for CCLG is the key to produce hydrogen-rich syngas. The 
common oxygen carrier used for CCLG consists of naturally occurring 
ores and transition metal oxides, such as natural iron ores, Co,Mn, Ni, 
Fe, and Cu oxides [18–20]. The favorable properties of oxygen carrier 
include low cost, high oxygen storage and transport capacity, high 
reactivity in redox reactions, high mechanical and thermal stability. 
Among these oxygen carriers, Fe-based oxygen carrier appears to be an 
attractive candidate due to itslow cost, abundant natural source, high 
oxygen transport capacity and environmental friendliness [21].Wei and 
co-workers demonstrated that chemical looping gas-
ification oflignite with hematite as oxygen carrier is capable of obtain -
ing high quality syngas. It is found that the crystal phase evolution of 
hematite oxygen carrier during chemical looping gasification follows 
the reaction path of Fe2O3 → Fe0.963O → Fe2O3 [22]. However, Fe-based 
oxygen carrier exhibited low redox reaction rate with coal, especially 
coal char. The solid –solid reaction between char and oxygen carrier is 
the rate-limiting step during CCLG. Ni and Cu-based oxygen carriers 
exhibits very high reactivity with coal. Shen and co-workers found that 
NiO exhibited high reactivity above 900 •C during chemical looping 
combustion of coal, and the CO2 concentration (dry basis) in the exit gas 
of the fuel reactor was nearly 95% [23]. Dennis and co-workers showed 
that the gasification rates of lignite and its derived char over CuO/ 
γ-Al2O3 at 900 •C were significant, and CuO/ γ-Al2O3 acted as a durable 
oxygen carrier over 20 redox cycles. It was observed that CuO decom -
posed at 900 •C to generate O2and Cu2O, and both reacted with CO 
produced by gasification, whilst the O2reacted directly with the lignite 
derived char[24]. Unfortunately, Ni and Cu are expensive, toxic and, 
carcinogenic [25,26] . As a novel kind of mixed metal oxide, ferrites 
(MFe 2O4) with a spinel structure have attracted increasing attention due 
to its high thermal stability, good magnetic properties and high oxygen 
capacity [27]. Among various ferrites, NiFe 2O",536,"[ 0.0143764  -0.00606812  0.01564418 ...  0.01481951 -0.03333159

most potential ones since Fe-based oxygen carrier cooperated with 
highly reactive Ni and Cu can combine the complementary advantages of individual Fe or Ni/Cu. Ignacio J. et al. used NiFe2O4 as catalyst for 
the chemical looping conversion of CO2 and found that Ni-Fe clusters 
forming on the surface of the ferrite nanoparticle result from the 
segregation of metal atoms recruited from octahedral sites of the Ni- 
ferrite. Such change in the chemistry and structure of the catalyst has 
a profound impact on the activity of the catalyst [28]. Huang et al. 
confirmed the good reactivity of NiFe 2O4 in the biomass chemical 
looping gasification process [29]. Marcel et al. tested NiFe 2O4 as a 
combined catalyst precursor and oxygen transfer material for improved 
conversion of methane into syngas [30]. The superior behavior of nickel 
iron oxide compared to iron oxide were demonstrated and the enhanced 
catalytic activity is attributed to the generation of fresh nickel surfaces 
during the reduction of the metal oxide. Niu et al. evaluated the com-
bustion performance in chemical looping combustion of sewage sludge 
in a batch fluidized-bed reactor by using CuFe 2O4 as oxygen carrier. The 
formation of CuFe 2O4 could improve both the reactivity of Fe2O3 species 
through synergetic effect and the physical stability of CuO during redox 
reactions [31]. Zhu et al. investigated CuFe 2O4 as oxygen carrier for coal 
chemical looping gasification and found that presence of ferrite better 
relieved the deep oxygen loss of CuFe 2O4. Synergistic effect between Cu- 
Fe made a great contribution to the reduction process [32]. 
Up to data, there is a lack of information on the comparative 
assessment of chemical looping gasification of coal over different 
NiFe 2O4 and CuFe 2O4 oxygen carriers to produce H2-rich syngas. 
Herein, four types of NiFe 2O4 and CuFe 2O4 are synthesized by sol–gel 
method and solid-phase method. Several researchers have observed that 
different synthesis methods can influence the size and morphology of 
ferrites nanoparticles and hence affect the activity [33]. As generally 
known, sol–gel method is the most effective method for the preparation 
of ferrites due to its advantages s",523,"[ 0.01460994 -0.03161019 -0.03009111 ...  0.01835178 -0.01353765

persibility, and easy operability. Meanwhile, solid-phase method was 
also commonly chosen because it’s more suitable for the oxygen carrier 
synthesis in large quantity. These two routes are expected to introduce 
morphological variation and different degree of interaction between the 
metals, which can modulate the catalytic performance. Chemical loop-
ing gasification of lignite over NiFe 2O4 and CuFe 2O4 is proposed for 
achieving efficient gasification of lignite. The effect of preparation 
methods of NiFe 2O4 and CuFe 2O4 and operating conditions (e.g., oxygen 
carrier to coal ratio, gasification temperature, reaction time, carrier gas 
flowrate, and the addition of steam) on the chemical looping gasification 
of lignite is systematically investigated by using thermogravimetric 
analyzer (TGA) and a fixed bed reactor. The oxygen carriers are char-
acterized by XRD, H2-TPR, and SEM. After the comparative assessment 
of oxygen carriers and the optimization of operating conditions, the 
technical feasibility to produce H2-rich syngas from chemical looping of 
lignite over selected oxygen carrier is thus verified and discussed. 
2.Experimental section 
2.1. Materials and preparation 
The coal sample used in the experiment is Yunnan lignite. The raw 
lignite was crushed by a pulverizer and sieved to obtain a coal sample 
with a particle size of 80–100 mesh. The lignite was dried at 105 •C for 
48 h, and stored in a dryer for later use after moisture removal. The 
proximate, ultimate analysis and heating value of lignite are shown in 
Table 1. The proximate analysis of lignite was tested based on the na-
tional standard GB/T212-2008. The elemental analysis of lignite was 
carried out on an elemental analyzer (Vario EL, Elementar). The higher 
heating value (HHV) of lignite was analyzed by using a bomb calorim -
eter (WZR-1 T-CII, Bente). 
CuFe 2O4 (or NiFe 2O4) was prepared by sol–gel method and solid- 
phase method. For the sol–gel method: the desired amounts of Fe

was 2:1:3.9. The aqueous solution was heated in a water bath (80 •C) 
under constant stirring to form gel. The resulting gel was dried at 105 •C 
for 24 h. The dried precursor was calcinated in a muffle furnace at 
400 •C with a heating rate of 10 •C/min for 2 h, and then heated to 
900 •C with a heating rate of 10 •C/min and held there for 6 h. The 
resulting sample was ground to obtain fresh oxygen carrier around 100 
mesh. For the solid-phase method: the desired amounts of iron oxide 
(Macklin, AR 99.95%) and copper oxide (Macklin, AR 99%) or nickel 
oxide (Aladdin, AR 99%) were ground and mixed evenly in a mortar. 
The molar ratio of Fe to Cu (or Ni) was 2:1. The mixture was calcinated 
at 900•C for 6 h to obtain fresh oxygen carrier. Finally, the obtained 
oxygen carriers were granulated and screened to 100 mesh. 
2.2. Characterization of oxygen carrier 
The crystalline phases of oxygen carriers were analyzed by an X-ray 
powder diffractometer (XRD) (X’Pert Pro MPD, PANalytical B.V.) with 
Cu Kα radiation (k 1.54060 Å) at 40 kV and 40 mA in the scanning 
range of 2θ 5-80•with a step size of 0.0167•. The morphology of 
oxygen carrier was recorded by using a scanning electron microscope 
(SEM) (S-4800, Hitachi). The hydrogen temperature programmed 
reduction (H2-TPR) of oxygen carrier was carried out in a full-automatic 
temperature programmed chemisorption analyzer (CPB-1, Quantach -
rome). The oxygen carrier was firstly heated to 300 •C with a heating 
rate of 20 •C /min under helium atmosphere to remove air from the 
system, and then cooled to 40 •C. After that, the gas atmosphere was 
switched to 10% H2/Ar. The sample was subsequently heated to 900 •C 
with a heating rate of 20 •C/min. the surface",531,"[-0.00067849 -0.027804   -0.01334236 ...  0.0136349  -0.00512263

analysis for chemical looping gasification of lignite over NiFe 2O4 and 
CuFe 2O4 was carried out in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) 
(PT1600, Netzsch, Germany). Thelignite and oxygen carrier were mixed 
evenly with a desired mass ratio in a mortar. The mixtures were heated 
from 30 to 1100 •C with a heating rate of 10 •C/min. High-purity argon 
was used as carrier gas with a flow rate of 100 ml/min. The syngas 
production from chemical looping gasification of lignite was performed 
in a fixed-bed reactor. Lignite and oxygen carrier were mixed evenly 
with a desired mass ratio in a mortar. The mixtures were fed into the 
fixed bed reactor via a ball valve. The chemical looping gasification of 
lignite was conducted at varying temperature (800 –1000 •C) with a 
constant residence time of 1 h. High purity argon with a flow rate of 100 
ml/min (unless otherwise stated) was used as the carrier gas. The syngas 
was collected by an airbag and then analyzed by a gas chromatography

3.Results and discussion 
3.1. The characterization of NiFe 2O4 and CuFe 2O4 synthesized by 
different methods 
The CuFe 2O4 and NiFe 2O4 oxygen carriers were prepared by sol–gel 
method and solid-phase method. The prepared oxygen carriers were 
subsequently characterized by XRD. The XRD patterns of the oxygen 
carriers are shown in Fig. 1. It is evident that the two CuFe 2O4 oxygen 
carriers have verysimilar XRD patterns. The diffraction peaks at 2θ 

(321), (224) and (400) crystal planes of CuFe 2O4 (JCPDS No. 
006–0545). Besides, unobvious crystalline planes of CuO and Fe3O4 can 
be observed for the CuFe 2O4 synthesized by sol–gel method, indicating 
its relatively single-phase cubic spinel structure. But the peak intensity

exhibits a single-phase cubic spinel structure. The diffraction peaks at 
2θ 30.3, 35.7, 37.3, 43.4, 53.8, 57.4 and 63.0•are attributed to the 
reflections from the (220), (311), (222), (400), (422), (511), (440) 
crystal planes of NiFe 2O4 (JCPDS No. 054–0964). However, some extra 
diffraction peaks corresponding to the crystalline planes of α-Fe2O3 and 
NiO were found in the XRD pattern of the NiFe 2O4 oxygen carrier pre-
pared by solid-phase method, indicating that the NiFe 2O4 oxygen carrier 
prepared by solid-stage method is a mixed phase of NiFe 2O4, α-Fe2O3 
and NiO. 
The H2-TPR profiles of CuFe 2O4 and NiFe 2O4 oxygen carriers syn-
thesized by different methods are illustrated in Fig. 2. It is obvious that 
there are two well-defined peaks in the H2-TPR profiles of CuFe 2O4 
oxygen carriers synthesized by sol–gel method and solid-phase method. 
The first reduction peak centered at 300–350 •C is attributed to the 
reduction of CuFe 2O4 to Cu and Fe2O3. And the second reduction peak 
centered at 550–600 •C is ascribed to the reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe. 
However, the peak temperature of CuFe 2O4 synthesized by sol–gel 
method is evidently lower than that of CuFe 2O4 synthesized by solid- 
phase method, indicating that CuFe 2O4 synthesized sol–gel method 
exhibit better reducibility at low temperature. Since the nitrate can be 
mixed more uniformly during the sol–gel synthetic process which may 
benefit the metal synergistic effect and enhance the reducibility. The Table 1

5The weight loss (TG) and weight loss rate (DTG) curves for chemical 
looping gasification of lignite over different oxygen carriers are showed 
in Fig. 3A and B. The occurrence of lignite gasification can be confirmed 
and the reactivity was significantly affected by the type of oxygen car-
rier. As shown in the Fig. 3B, the DTG curves for pyrolysis or chemical 
looping gasification of lignite can be divided into three stage. The first 
weight loss stage between 30 and 150 •C is attributed to the moisture 
evaporation. The second weight loss stage between 150 and 600 •C is 
mainly associated with the devolatilization reactions of lignite. It can be 
seen that the weight loss of lignite pyrolysis is overwhelmingly 
happened during the first devolatilization stage, indicating that all the 
lignite without oxygen carrier is pyrolysis to release the volatiles. It 
should be noted that a shoulder peak centered at about 465 or 485 •C is 
observed during chemical looping gasification of lignite with the two 
types of CuFe 2O4 oxygen carriers, which could be ascribed to the 
reforming of CuFe 2O4 with the volatiles from lignite pyrolysis. This 
result is corresponded with the H2-TPR results presented in Fig. 2A. 
Besides, it is also found that the CuFe 2O4 oxygen carrier synthesized by 
sol–gel method exhibits higher maximum weight loss rate at this tem-
perature, indicating that it has higher reforming reactivity with the 
pyrolysis volatiles. The last weight loss stage between 600 and 1100 •C is 
primarily ascribed to the lignite char gasification with oxygen carrier. 
The only DTG peak centered at approximately 700 •C during lignite 
pyrolysis without oxygen carrier is associated with the condensation

within ash (e.g., the decomposition of pyrite into pyrrhotite and/or iron 
sulfide) at this temperature [35]. While for the samples over CuFe 2O4 
and NiFe 2O4 oxygen carriers, two well-defined DTG peaks are observed 
for chemical looping gasification of lignite char at this stage. These 
gasification peak intensities are significantly improved when comparing 
with the pyrolysis of lignite without oxygen carrier, indicating that the 
lignite char can be effectively gasified by adding oxygen carrier, and 
different oxygen carriers provide different gasification reactivity with 
lignite char. The DTG peak centered at 680–700 •C for CuFe 2O4 oxygen 
carriers is predominantly attributed to the condensation of lignite char 
and the reduction of Fe2O3 with lignite char, due to its higher peak in-
tensity than that of lignite pyrolysis. Furthermore, there is a DTG peak 
centered at 1030 –1050 •C for CuFe 2O4 oxygen carriers, which can be 
related to the gasification of char with O2. It is speculated that CuO 
decomposes at high temperature to form Cu2O and O2 [36]. It is obvious 
that CuFe 2O4 synthesized by sol–gel method provides higher reforming 
reactivity with pyrolysis volatiles and lower gasification reactivity with 
lignite char when comparing with CuFe 2O4 synthesized by solid-phase 
method. That mainly because the Cu-Fe synergistic effect between 
CuFe 2O4 oxygen carriers synthesized by solid method are weaker than 
that made by sol–gel method, and higher temperature benefits the 
decompose of CuO and leads to the char combustion at 1030 –1050 •C. 
This result is also corresponded to the XRD results that showed higher 
CuO intensity peak for CuFe 2O4 synthesized by solid method. The DTG peak centered at 700–",441,"[ 0.03242979 -0.03981857 -0.00765828 ...  0.02243585  0.00605251

NiFe 2O4 to form syngas, Ni and Fe2O3. The DTG peak centered at 
880–930 •C for NiFe 2O4 oxygen carriers is ascribed to the char gasifi -
cation with Fe2O3. The NiFe 2O4 oxygen carrier synthesized by sol–gel 
method shows the highest weight loss rate in this last stage, indicating 
that it exerts the highest gasification reactivity with lignite char. The 
result could be due to the best mobility of lattice oxygen within NiFe 2O4 
oxygen carrier synthesized by sol–gel method, which is further 
confirmed by the result obtained from Fig. 2B. It is worth noting that 
these DTG peaks are not in line with the reduction peaks obtained from 
H2-TPR. The results could be due to the difference in the reducibility of 
lignite char and H2. 
The TG/DTG curves for chemical looping gasification of lignite over 
NiFe 2O4 oxygen carrier synthesized by sol–gel method with varying 
oxygen carrier to coal ratio (O/C ratio) are plotted in Fig. 4A and B. It is 
observed that the intensity of the peak centered at 430 •C, related to the 
devolatilization reactions of lignite at the second stage, decreases 
continuously with increasing O/C ratio. It is due to the decreasing 
content of lignite in the mixture of oxygen carriers and lignite. Elevating 
O/C ratio from 0 to 1 significantly improved the maximum weight loss 
rate for both two peaks in the stage of char gasification, suggesting that 
the increasing supply of lattice oxygen within NiFe 2O4 is beneficial to 
improve the gasification reactivity of lignite char. However, further 
elevating O/C ratio from 1 to 3/1, their peak temperature shifts toward 
high temperature. The results might be attributed to t",448,"[ 0.04145302 -0.02395508  0.01251367 ...  0.02999982  0.00098536

3.3. The optimization of operating conditions for chemical looping 
gasification of lignite over NiFe 2O4 synthesized by sol–gel method. 
The NiFe 2O4 synthesized by sol–gel method was selected as the ox-
ygen carrier for the optimization of operating conditions of chemical 
looping gasification of lignite, since it can provide the highest gasifica -
tion reactivity with lignite char. The effect of reaction temperature on 
the performance of chemical looping gasification of lignite is presented 
in Fig. 5. It can be seen that the gasification temperature exerts signif -
icant impact on the gas yield, carbon conversion and syngas selectivity. 
As the gasification temperature increases from 800 •C, the total gas 
yield, carbon conversion, and syngas selectivity first increased and then 
start to decrease when the gasification temperature went to 950 •C. The 
maximum values of total gas yield, carbon conversion, and syngas 
selectivity can reach 24.5 mol/kg, 40.43%, and 69.0% respectively at 
the gasification temperature of 900 •C. It is well accepted that elevating 
gasification temperature can significantly promote the gasification rate 
of oxygen carrier with pyrolysis volatiles and char, thus improving the

6carbon conversion and syngas production during chemical looping 
gasification of lignite. However, high-temperatures (950 •C) could cause 
the metal sintering and particle agglomeration of the NiFe 2O4 oxygen 
carrier [37]. Both phenomena significantly reduce the gasification rate 
and performance of theNiFe 2O4 oxygen carrier during lignite gasifica -
tion. This challenge could be effectively overcome via applying highly 
dispersed NiFe 2O4 on inert support (e.g., Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2, and ZrO2) 
as oxygen carrier. 
The evolution profiles of syngas production from chemical looping 
gasification of lignite as a function of reaction time is depicted in Fig. 6A. 
As the reaction time increases, the total gas yield first increases and then 
smoothly dropped. The maximum total gas yield of 7.34 mol/kg and the 
highest syngas yield of 4.53 mol/kg are reached during the reaction 
process from 5 to 10 min. The carbon conversion and syngas selectivity 
also firstly increase and reach their maximum values at the reaction time 
of 10 to 15 min. As the reaction time reaches 35 min, the syngas 
selectivity starts to increase considerably. When the reaction time is 
greater than 60 min, the total gas yield is very low (D0.1 mol/kg), 
implying that the gasification rate becomes very slow at that time. The

vation of oxygen carrier at that time caused by the cracking of CO2 on 
oxygen carrier to form coke. Another one is the complete release of 
volatiles from lignite at that time. The residual volatiles release from 
lignite char is the key for initiating the solid –solid reaction between 
oxygen carrier and lignite char [38]. It is thus concluded that the suitable reaction time for chemical looping gasification should be 
greater than 35 min to ensure the effective conversion of lignite char. 
The effect of Ar flowrate on the syngas production from chemical 
looping gasification of lignite is shown in Fig. 6B. It is evident that the 
optimal flowrate is 100 ml/min, since it provides the maximum the total 
gas yield, CO yield, H2 yield, carbon conversion and syngas selectivity. 
The Ar flowrate is related with the vapor residence time. Low Ar flow-
rate, corresponding to long vapor residence time, may promotes the 
vapor reforming reactions, such as the reverse water –gas shift reaction, 
thus resulting in the low gas yield. In addition, low Ar flowrate may 
improves the cracking of CO2 over partially reduced NiFe 2O4 to form CO 
and coke. The serious coke of oxygen carrier causes the rapid deacti -

contact time between NiFe 2O4 and pyrolysis vapors, also leading to the 
low gas yield and carbon conversion. It is well accepted that the volatiles 
release from lignite char could significantly impact the solid –solid re-
action between oxygen carrier and lignite char[38]. Minor volatiles 
could initiate the solid –solid reaction, and subsequent the CO2, derived 
from combustion of volatiles, induces an in-situ CO2 gasification of 
lignite char via Boudouard reaction, which may become a driving force 
for the continuous reduction of the oxygen carrier and thus to produce 
CO2. It is inferred that the volatiles can be rapidly carried out by the high 
flowrate, thus lowering the solid –solid reaction rate between lignite char 
and oxygen carrier. It is thus concluded that the optimal gasification 
temperature, reaction time, and Ar flowrate for chemical looping gasi-
fication of lignite are 900 •C, 60 min, and 100 ml/min.

increasing O/C ratio provides more lattice oxygen, thus improving the 
conversion of volatiles and char into syngas and water. The speculation 
is verified by the fact that the CO2 yield enhanced with increasing O/C 
ratio. The CO2, CO, H2 and CH4 yields from lignite pyrolysis are 1.86, 
3.76, 5.61, and 1.44 mol/kg. The CO and CO2 yield are enhanced by 
adding the CuFe 2O4 oxygen carrier synthesized by sol–gel method. As 
the O/C ratio increases from 0 to 3, the CO2 yield increases continuously 
from 1.86 to 12.61 mol/kg, while the CO increases gradually from 3.76 
to 13.65%. In contrast, the CH4 and H2 yield are reduced by adding the 
CuFe 2O4 oxygen carrier. The increasing supply of lattice oxygen pro-
motes the oxygenation of H2, CO, CH4, and char, resulting in the for-
mation of more CO, CO2, and H2O.

CO2 yield increases from 2.70 to 7.99 mol/kg, while the CO and H2 yield 
first increase and then decrease. The maximum CO yield of 11.94 mol/ 
kg is obtained at the O/C ratio of 3/2. And the highest H2 yield is pro-
duced at the O/C ratio of 2/3. It is evident that the gasification perfor -
mance of this oxygen carrier is significantly different from that of the 
CuFe 2O4 oxygen carrier synthesized by sol–gel method. It could be 
explained by the results obtained from Fig. 3B. The CuFe 2O4 synthesized 
by solid-phase method gives lower reforming reactivity with pyrolysis volatiles and higher gasification reactivity with lignite char when 
comparing with CuFe 2O4 synthesized by sol–gel method. It is thus

The comparison of the performance of four oxygen carriers during 
chemical looping gasification of lignite under the optimal operating 
conditions is given in Fig. 9. It is obvious that, among the four oxygen 
carriers, NiFe 2O4 synthesized by sol–gel method exhibits the highest 
carbon conversion of 40.4%, the highest total gas yield of 24.47 mol/kg, 
the highest H2 yield of 7.32 mol/kg, the highest syngas selectivity of 
69.0, and the highest H2/CO ratio of 0.77. It is thus concluded that the 
NiFe 2O4 synthesized by so-gel method is the best oxygen carrier for 
maximizing the production of H2, which is also corresponded to its best 
activity of TG results. During the sol–gel synthesis process, nitrate can be 
mixed more uniformly and highly cubic spinel structure can be obtained 
to improve the mobility of lattice oxygen and enhance the metal syn-
ergistic effect. Besides, the combustion of organic material (citric acid) 
initially during the calcination process may be beneficial for the porous 
structure of the sample [39]. Compared to CuFe 2O4, Fe-Ni synergistic 
effect provided higher gasification reactivity with lignite char which is 
very important for the coal gasification since char accounting for more 
than 30% in pyrolysis products. Huang et al. investigated ferrites as 
oxygen carriers for chemical looping gasification of biomass and found 
that the presence of Fe-Ni alloy phase and Fe-Ni spinel structure phase

method to further improve its gasification performance. 
3.5. The H2-rich syngas production from chemical looping gasification of 
lignite over NiFe 2O4 in the presence of steam 
Steam was added to chemical looping gasification of lignite as an 
additional gasifying agent to promote the production of hydrogen-rich 
syngas. The effect of the steam flowrate on the syngas production 
from chemical looping gasification of lignite is illustrated in Fig. 10A. It 
is found that the carbon conversion, gas yield, and syngas selectivity are 
improved by the addition of steam. As the steam flowrate increases from 
0 to 0.1 ml/min, the carbon conversion increases noticeably from 40.4 
to 67.5%, while the total gas yield and H2 yield rises drastically from 
24.47 and 7.32 to 64.98 and 36.11 mol/kg, respectively. The results 
could be due to that the addition of steam can accelerate the direct 
conversion of lignite char with steam via water –gas reaction. However, 
the addition of steam can also improve the consumption of CO to form CO2 and H2 via water –gas shift reactions. Hence, the syngas selectivity 
first increases and then decreases as increasing steam flowrate. The 
maximum syngas selectivity of 77.9% is reached at the steam flowrate of 
0.025 ml/min. The effect of steam flowrate on the H2/CO ratio of syngas 
from chemical looping gasification of lignite is drawn in Fig. 10B. It is 
evident that steam can serve as hydrogen source for improving the H2/ 
CO ratio of syngas via water –gas shift reactions and methane steam 
reforming reactions. As the steam flowrate increases from 0 to 0.1 ml/ 
min, the H2/CO ratio rises from 0.77 to 2.79, suggesting that the H2/CO 
ratio of syngas can be flexibly adjusted to meet the need of downstr",469,"[-0.00973253 -0.01762524 -0.02930645 ... -0.01115866 -0.02826135

increasing the concentration of steam as reactant shifts the chemical 
equilibrium of water –gas shift reaction towards the right based on Le 
Chatelier ’s principle. The results are in line with the fact that the H2 and 
CO2 yields rise progressively with increasing steam flowrate. 
3.6. Surface morphology analysis of fresh, reduced, and regenerated 
oxygen carriers 
The surface morphology of the fresh, reduced, and regenerated 
NiFe 2O4 oxygen carriers was characterized by SEM. As shown in Fig. 11, 
the surface of the fresh NiFe 2O4 is smooth and dense, with a few of pore 
structures existed on its surface. After reaction with lignite, the surface 
of the reduced NiFe 2O4 is relatively rough and more pore structures and 
smaller particle sizes are shown, which may be resulted from the transfer 
of lattice oxygen within NiFe 2O4 to lignite via gasification reactions. 
After regeneration with air, very regular pore structures are observed on 
the surface of regenerated NiFe 2O4. These pore structures could be 
formed by the combustion of char and coke within reduced oxygen 
carrier. Serious sintering and agglomeration phenomena are not found 
in the reduced and regenerated oxygen carriers, suggesting the NiFe 2O4 
oxygen carrier synthesized by sol–gel method is a good candidate for 
achieving of efficient gasification of lignite. 
4.Conclusion 
It is demonstrated that, among four types of oxygen carrier, NiFe 2O4 
synthesized by sol–gel method exhibits the highest gasification reac-
tivity with lignite char at an O/C ratio of 1. XRD and H2-TPR analysis 
shows that the highly pure cubic spinel structure of this oxygen carrier is

the NiFe 2O4 synthesized by sol–gel method exhibits the highest total gas

gasification of lignite under the optimal operating conditions. However, 
its gasification performance, especially the carbon conversion and H2/

24.47 mol/kg and 0.77 to 64.98 mol/kg and 2.79. Considering the good

combining with the advantages such as the relatively cheap price of raw 
materials and the easy preparation process that been able to scale up, 
NiFe 2O4 would be a promising selection for the coal chemical looping 
technology. These findings provide a novel and efficient method to 
obtain H2-rich syngas via chemical looping gasification of lignite.

Chemical looping gasification (CLG) is one of the promising ways to exploit biomass resources and produce 
hydrogen-rich syngas. In this work, two spinel oxygen carrier (NiMn 2O4 and NiFe 2O4) were studied for

H2 and TPD-CO 2 were used to investigate the fresh and spent oxygen carriers. The result reveals that the 
NiMn 2O4 oxygen carrier has higher reactivity and redox performance due to its higher oxygen vacancy con-
centration. On the other hand, the NiMn 2O4 oxygen carrier obtain greater reactivity for hydrogen generation due 
to its phases and structure changes. NiMn 2O4 oxygen carrier was reduced form (NiO) 0.25(MnO) 0.75 to 
(NiO) 0.75(MnO) 0.25 to Ni MnO phases at 650-850 •C. Ni generated adhere to sufure of MnO, and the structure 
become loose and porous. And the more oxygen vacancise was formed. However, NiFe 2O4 oxygen carrier showed 
different reduction behavior, it reduced from Ni1.25Fe1.85O4 to Fe2O3 Ni3Fe phases at 650–850 •C. The formed 
Ni phase for NiMn 2O4 oxygen carrier promote hydrogen gas generation (2.65Nm3/kg) at 800 •C. Based on the 
charaterize analysis, the proposed reaction process was explained. For the hydrogen-rich syngas production, the 
optimum conditions in this works shows at temperature (800 •C), steam flow (80 μL/min) and ratio of oxygen

1.Introduction 
Hydrogen gas is regarded as one of the cleanest energy resources; 
however, it is not abundant in nature. Thus, it is mostly derived from 
fossil fuels [1–4]. However, an alternate source is required because of 
the high pollution and non-renewability of fossil fuels. Biomass is 
recognized as one of the most attractive alternatives to fossil fuels as a 
renewable energy source [5–7]. The conversion of biomass into 
hydrogen-rich syngas is mostly accomplished by thermochemical, pho-
tocatalytic and biochemical processes [8,9] . The thermochemical 
method is very efficient and has a faster reaction rate. Gasification is a 
promising and economical thermochemical way to convert diverse 
biomass types for hydrogen-rich syngas [10,11] . Conventional gasifi -
cation has received extensive interest, requiring steam, air, and oxygen 
as agent. Oxygen and air are efficient agents; however, they expensive due to the high cost of gas separation [12,13] . In contrast, the steam 
agent is less active and has a generation cost. Chemical looping gasifi -
cation (CLG) is an emerging technology that is hi",264,"[ 0.0058743   0.03544623 -0.00509148 ... -0.0168213  -0.01275062

current research due to its potential to avoid gas dilution by nitrogen 
[14]. In the chemical looping gasification process, the oxygen carrier is 
cycled between reduction and oxygen reactors. Lattice oxygen of oxygen 
carrier reacts with biomass producing syngas in the reduction reactor 
instead of air oxygen or produced oxygen gas. The reduced oxygen 
carrier is then transported into an oxygen reactor for re-oxidation by air. 
In addition, oxygen carrier play as a heat transfer medium between the 
reactors. As a result, CLG improves thermal efficiency and syngas pro-
duction quality [15,16] . 
Oxygen carrier plays an essential role in CLG, and its most important 
properties are high reactivity, oxygen capacity, and cyclic stability.

2properties are high reactivity, oxygen capacity, and cyclic stability [17]. 
Transitional metals (Ni, Fe, Mn, Co and Cu-based oxygen carrier have 
been studied and considered suitable oxygen carrier candidates 
[18–21]. These transition metals can catalyze breaking C–C and C–H 
bonds and water gas shift (WGS) reaction. Especially, Ni-based oxygen 
carrier is widely studied due to its high-reactivity towards H2 production 
owing to catalyzing dissociation of C–H and C–C bonds and low cost. 
However, coke deposition can occur on Ni-based oxygen carrier causing 
sintering and deactivation [22,23] . In contrast, Fe, Cu, and Mn, have 
good resistant ability for coke deposition with negligible environmental 
and health concerns. However, they are not catalytic as Ni [24]. 
Accordingly, the bimetallic oxygen carriers to achieve synergy are the 
most promising candidates [25]. 
Among bimetallic oxygen carriers, spinel structure (AB 2O4) has good 
performance in CLG, and the transition metals can occupy A and B sites 
and improve oxygen transformation [26]. Ni can form spinel oxygen 
carriers such as NiFe 2O4 and NiMn 2O4, which were studied extensively. 
Zhao et al. [27] studied the NiFe 2O4 as an oxygen carrier with lignite 
char for hydrogen-rich syngas production via CLG. They revealed high 
reactivity due to the synergy effect between Fe and Ni. Huang et al. [28] 
reported that the biomass char with NiFe 2O4 oxygen carrier performs 
better than Fe2O3 and Fe2O3 NiO oxygen carrier. It is attributed to Fe/ 
Ni synergistic effect in the spinel structure. Ma et al. [29] studied the 
phase segregation mechanism of NiFe 2O4 oxygen carrier. It is indicated 
that the reduction degree significantly influenced the phase segregation 
of NiFe 2O4 and the phase composition effect on the redox cycles.",459,"[ 0.02008772 -0.00074867  0.01146109 ...  0.02461053 -0.01353148

Liu et al. [30] studied the synergy effect of NiMn 2O4 oxygen carrier on 
the reactivity using the thermogravimetric analysis technology. They 
found that the NiMn 2O4 was reduced by CO, generating Ni and MnO. 
The former will synergistically promote the reduction of Mn2O3 and 
MnO. Wang et al. [31] studied hydrogen production using NiMn 2O4 
spinel as an oxygen carrier. The result showed that it still acted as re-
actants while being reduced at same time. Generation of MnO and 
metallic species could improve the activity. These results reveal that the 
synergistic effect of bimetallic can enhance hydrogen-rich syngas pro-
duction. In the biomass CLG process, oxygen carrier and biochar reac-
tion is an important step. However, the relation between gas 
composition and phased oxygen carrier has been less reported. 
In this work, the NiMn 2O4 and NiFe 2O4 were used as oxygen carriers 
with biochar with a steam agent. A series of characterization techniques 
were used to investigate the fresh and spent oxygen carriers, including 
XRD, XPS, BET, TPR-H 2, SEM and TPD-CO 2. Meanwhile, the optimum 
conditions for hydrogen-rich syngas production have been studied at 
different temperatures (650 –850 •C), steam flow (60–100 mL/min), and 
the ratio of oxygen carrier with biochar (0:4, 1:3 2:2 3:1, and 4:0) were 
also investigated. 
2.Experimental 
2.1. Synthesis of oxygen carrier 
NiMn 2O4 and NiFe 2O4 oxygen carriers were synthesized by sol–gel as 
follows. Ni(NO 3)2⋅6H2O, Fe(NO 3)3⋅9H2O, and Mn(NO 3)2⋅4H2O are used 
as raw materials. The solution of Ni(NO 3)2⋅6H2O, Fe(NO 3)3⋅9H2O, and 
Mn(NO 3)2⋅4H2O were mixed and stirred at 80 •C. Then, the citric acid 
solution has added to the mixture solution with a mole ratio (metal and

mixture",551,"[ 0.06046962  0.00575954  0.00477641 ...  0.01872687 -0.01526223

tion has continuously stirred at 80 •C until the formation of a wet gel. 
The wet gel has then dried at 105 •C for 24 h to obtain the dry gel and 
then calcined at 500 •C for 1 h and 850 •C for 3 h in air condition with 
5 •C/min. Then obtained oxygen carriers has crushed and sieved into 
particles of 106–120 μm. 2.2. Prepared biomass char 
Straw (Chengdu, China) is used as a biomass source. It pyrolyzed for 
1 h at N2 (50 mL/min) and 800 •C with 5 •C/min. Then obtained, bio-
char was crushed and sieved into particles with a size range of 106–120 
μm. The ultimate and proximate analysis of straw char has done in the 
guide of American Society for Testing and Materials D1102-84(2007) 
standard [32], and the results shown in Table 1. 
2.3. Characterization 
X-ray diffraction (XRD: X’ Pert Pro MPD) has been utilized for testing 
crystal phases of fresh and spent oxygen carriers (NiMn 2O4 and 
NiFe 2O4). It uses Cu Ka radiation operated at 40 kV and 40 mA with a 
scan range from 20•to 80•with 2•/min. 
The surface elementals of fresh and spent oxygen carriers (NiMn 2O4 
and NiFe 2O4) have been detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 
(XPS, Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD) with amonochromatized Al kα X-ray 
source. Binding energies of elements reference C 1 s hydrocarbon peak at 
284.8 eV. And the specific surface areas and pore size distributions were 
analyzed using BET (TriStar II Series device) with nitrogen adsorption 
and desorption isotherms at  196 •C. 
H2-temperature programmed reduction (TPR-H 2) has been per-
formed using TPDPO 1100 Series equipment with TCD. The test has 
performed with 50 mg of oxygen carriers with 5 % H2/N2 (50 mL/min) 
and 10 •C/min at 30-950 •C. CO2-Temperature-programmed desorption

TPDPO 1100 Series. About 200 mg of each sample was adsorbed at 50 •C 
for 1 h using 10 % CO2/N2 gas. Desorption of CO2 was investigated in the 
range of 30-950 •C at a step of 10 •C/min. 
2.4. Reactivity investigation 
Fixed-bed system has been utilized to investigate the reactivity of 
oxygen carriers with biochar at various conditions: temperatures (650- 
850 •C), steam flow (60–100 mL/min), and the ratios of oxygen carrier 
and biochar (0:4, 1:3, 2:2, 3:1, 4:0). The schematic of fixed-bed system is 
same with previous work [33]. In CLG process, the ratio between oxygen 
carrier and biochar with steam (80 mL/min) is 1:1 (0.2 g:0.2 g) at 650- 
850 •C and using Ar (50 mL/min) as gas carrier. Similar ratio of oxygen 
carrier and biochar is investigated at the effect on steam flows. After 
cooling and drying, producing gas is detected by a thermal conductivity 
detector (TCD) using an online gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890), 
including H2, CO, CO2, and CH4. The TDX-01 column has selected for H2, 
CO, and CH4 analysis. The Porapak Q column is selected for analysis of 
CO2. 
2.5. Data definition 
The performance of fixed-bed reactor using different oxygen carriers 
(NiFe 2O4 and NiMn 2O4) were studied based on carbon conversion, yield, 
gas composition and H2/CO ratio. These calculation methods are 
different reforming liquid and gas in previous reported work [34,35] .

the (220), (311), (222), (400), (422), (511), (440) [27]. 
The crystal sizes of NiMn 2O4 and NiFe 2O4 oxygen carriers were 
analyzed using the Scherrer formula [37]. The lattice planes (311) were 
selected to evaluate crystal sizes due to the highest intensity of NiMn 2O4 
and NiFe 2O4 oxygen carriers. The result explains that the crystal size of 
NiMn 2O4 (7.55 nm) is lower than NiFe 2O4(8.73 nm) as shown in 
Table S1. It is indicated that the Mn and Fe with Ni formation spinel 
structure have different crystal size. The lower crystal size is benefit to 
resist agglomeration, promoting catalyst activity. Hence, it is one of factor for greater activity with NiMn 2O4 oxygen carrier.

The reduction properties of the oxygen carrier have a significant 
effect on chemical looping gasifcation, particularly, the Ni-based oxygen 
carrier. Because it is reduced with hydrogen production, resulting in the 
separation of Ni metal. Fig. 2 shows that different H2-TPR profiles of

NiFe 2O4 oxygen carrier is due to reduction of NiO to Ni (Ni2→Ni0) at 
416.6 •C. Generally, reduction tempreature of Ni is low about 400- 
580 •C. In contrast, the reduction temperature of Ni for the NiMn 2O4 
oxygen carrier its higher about 439.9 •C. It is indicated the NiFe 2O4 has

However, the maintain of activity was also considered. With reduction 
temperature enhance for the NiFe 2O4, the Fe2O3 was reduced to 
Fe3O4(Fe3→ Fe2Fe3) at 677.1 •C, and further reduced to Fe (Fe2
Fe3→ Fe0) at 750 •C,respectively [38]. Simultaneously, the NiMn 2O4 
was also reduced at high temperature, which is assigned to Mn3→ 
Mn2→ Mn0 at 694.7 •C [39]. The result shows NiMn 2O4 have lower 
reduction temperature, suggesting in the lattice oxygen easily transform 
and relased. The lattice oxygen can oxidize coke depostion for delay 
reavtivity of Ni. Therefore, the NiMn 2O4 oxygen carrier could be shown 
the greater activity for hyrogen production.

(below 300 •C), medium (300-600 •C), and strong (over 600 •C). The 
strong basic site is the main component for both oxygen carriers as 
shown in Fig. 3. The results show that the NiMn 2O4 oxygen carrier has 
large peak width at 770.8 •C, indicating it has a stronger basic site. One 
reason for the low activity of Ni-based oxygen carriers is coke deposition 
due to reducing substances, such as generated hydrogen and char car-
bon, which cause Ni separation. Basicity is beneficial for coke deposition 
resistance to keep the reactivity of the Ni-based oxygen carrier. 
Compared with the NiMn 2O4 oxygen carrier, the intensity of basic for 
NiFe 2O4 oxygen carrier is weak, and its peak not obvious. However, a Table 1

NiFe 2O4 is stronger than NiMn 2O4. In our work, the reaction tempera -
ture for hydrogen-rich syngas generation was studied below 850 •C. It 
was indicated the NiMn 2O4 oxygen carrier is better in resistant coke 
deposition to hold activity for hydrogen-rich syngas production. 
3.4. XPS analysis 
The valence information of surface elements is vital for the chemical 
looping process, and it can identify by XPS technology, particularly the 
type of O element. The NiMn 2O4 and NiFe 2O4 oxygen carriers have three 
types of oxygen, as shown in Fig. 4 (a)-(b), including lattice oxygen (OL), 
surface labile oxygen O-(Os), and O2– from physi- and chemisorbed 
water (Oad), which shows approximately at 530 eV, 532 eV and 533 eV, 
respectively [40]. Compared with NiFe 2O4, NiMn 2O4 has a higher con-
tent of Os (53.5 %), as shown in Table S2, suggesting that more oxygen 
vacancies have been generated. Oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in 
transforming lattice oxygen and electrical, as shown in previous work 
[41]. It was calculated by the ratio of Os/(OL Os), and the result is 
shown in Table 1. The result shows that the content of oxygen vacancies 
with NiMn 2O4 is 0.70, which is more than NiFe 2O4 (0.38), indicating a 
higher activity for hydrogen production due to catalyzing WGS reaction. 
Ni reveals catalysis activity for hydrogen production. Fig. 4 (c)-(d) 
shows two significant peaks on NiMn 2O4 and NiFe 2O4 oxygen carriers 
with binding energies around 854.6 eV and 872.6 eV for NiMn 2O4 and 
854.9 eV and 872.5 eV for NiFe 2O4 corresponding to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 
2p1/2 respectively. The result revealed trivial differences in the binding 
energy positions between the two oxygen carriers, r",519,"[ 0.01754435 -0.00490003 -0.02360954 ...  0.02709542  0.00854872

different features [42]. The Ni2ion has two types of occupying spinel 
structure: octahedral (Ni2:O) on the B site and tetrahedral (Ni2:T) on 
the A site. The different ratio of Ni2type indicates structure stability. 
Generally, the octahedral structure of Ni2is less stable. The content of 
Ni2(O) for NiFe 2O4 is higher than NiMn 2O4, as shown in Table S3, and 
the ratio of Ni2(O)/Ni2(T) are 1.07 and 1.11, as shown in Table 2. This 
means that the NiMn 2O4 has a more stable structure. 
The valence of Fe and Mn ions affects oxygen vacancies generation. 
Fig. 4(e)-(f) shows Mn3(641.6 eV) and Mn4(644.6 eV) for NiMn 2O4 
oxygen carrier, and binding energies around 710.9 eV and 724.4 eV for 
NiFe 2O4 corresponding to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 respectively, which 
are divided into Fe3and Fe2[43]. The valence changed to balance the 
deficit, probably generating the surface oxygen vacancies. According to 
the ion content shown in Table S3, the Fe2/Fe3and Mn3/Mn4were 
calculated as 0.43 and 1.33, as shown in Table 2. This means that the 
NiMn 2O4 oxygen carrier could generate more oxygen vacancies, con-
sisting of surface O results. 3.5. BET and SEM anaylsis 
The relative surface areas of NiMn 2O4 and NiFe 2O4 oxygen carriers 
show in Table 3. The result shows that the relative surface area of 
NiMn 2O4 and NiFe 2O4 oxygen carriers is small. It can be explained by 
SEM result as shown in Fig. S1. The surface of NiMn 2O4 and NiFe 2O4 
oxygen carriers shows compact, which could be attributed to synthesis 
temperature. Though, NiMn 2O4 oxygen carrier is higher relative surface 
area than NiFe 2O4 oxygen carrier. It can be ignored the affect of reac-
tivity by relative surface area. The relative surface area of oxygen carrier

3.6. Activity test 
3.6.1. Effect of temperature with NiMn 2O4 and NiFe 2O4 
The gas composition and gas yield are affected by temperature. Fig. 5 
(a)-(d) shows it at oxygen carrier to biochar ratio 1:1. The CO is the main 
gas composition at 650 •C for NiMn 2O4 oxygen carrier, while it shows a 
decrease with the rising temperature as shown in Fig. 5(a). It is indicated 
that the reactivity of WGS reaction is low, resulting in a lot of CO un-
converted. Although, the WGS reaction tend to hydrogen generation at 
low temperature since it is an exothermic process. It needs a certain 
amount of heat at kinetics. The carbon conversion and H2 yield display 
noticeable enhancement with rising temperature, as shown in Fig. 5(a)- 
(b). The results reveal that the maximum carbon conversion and 
hydrogen yields are 66.24 % and 2.65Nm3/kg at 800 •C. On the con-
trary, a higher temperature at 850 •C could suppress the WGS reaction, 
and the oxygen carrier structure changed, causing hydrogen yield to 
decrease. 
Compared with the NiMn 2O4, the CO also was the main composition 
with NiFe 2O4 at low temperature (650 •C), as shown in Fig. 5(c). And, 
the hydrogen gas composition displays enhance with rising temperature 
due to promote WGS reaction. Its trend corresponds with the NiMn 2O4 
oxygen carrier. However, carbon conversion varies from 6.62 % to 52.4 
%, which is lower than NiMn 2O4 oxygen carrier under the same condi -
tions. On the contrary, the trend of hydrogen gas yield shows 
enhancement with rising temperature, and the maximum hydrogen gas 
yield is 2.10Nm3/kg at 850 •C. These results indicated that the NiMn 2O4 
has a higher hydrogen production activity at a low",474,"[ 0.02285794 -0.00877685  0.00461377 ...  0.01463001  0.00776569

the NiFe 2O4. From the redox and surface element result, NiMn 2O4 ox-
ygen carrier has higher redox and oxygen vacancies, which is one reason 
for showing high hydrogen-rich syngas activity with the NiMn 2O4 oxy-
gen carrier. 
The spent NiMn 2O4 and NiFe 2O4 oxygen carriers after chemical 
looping gasification are shown in Fig. 6(a)-(b). The mixture phases 
(NiO) 0.25(MnO) 0.75 and (NiO) 0.75(MnO) 0.25 were detected at 650 •C. 
With enhancing temperature, the (NiO) 0.75(MnO) 0.25 phase disappears 
and tends to form (NiO) 0.25(MnO) 0.75, MnO and Ni phases at 700 •C. In 
the end, the NiMn 2O4 oxygen carrier was formed Ni and MnO phases 
over 750 •C. The result revealed that the Ni was separated with 
increasing temperature due to more hydrogen gas generation. The 
separated Ni benefits catalytic C–C and C–H bonds for hydrogen gas 
production [44]. For further investigation of Ni effect, the crystal size of 
Ni is calculated at different temperatures using Debye-Scherrer Eqution 
(as shown in Table S4). The result display that the crystal size of Ni show 
decreases from 0.77 nm to 0.51 nm with increasing temperature, as 
shown in Table S4. Lower Ni crystal size improves catalytic activity due 
to its effect on the adsorption capacity of CO. The more active surface 
was exposed, enhancing the ability of CO converted to H2 for WGS re-
action [45]. 
Compared with the NiMn 2O4, the spent NiFe 2O4 shows different 
phases, especially, the status of Ni with high temperature. The 
Ni1.25Fe1.85O4 phase has detected at 650 •C, indicating partial Fe phase 
separation. For further rising the temperature, the Fe phase was 
completely separated at 700 •C, and it formed Fe2O3. However, the

have an optimum ratio. And this trend of change was very similar to that 
was previously reported [53]. This result could be caused by hindering 
biochar oxidization due to higher oxygen carrier ratio and biochar. 
However, any gas production was undetected at only the oxygen carrier. 
The result indicated that the oxygen carrier is unreactive with steam, 
and the oxygen carrier participates in the process of biochar.

for hydrogen-rich syngas production at 800 •C, 80 mL/min, and a ratio 
of 1:1.

NiFe 20Ox oxygen carrierABSTRACT
Microwave-assisted heating coupled with chemical looping gasification was first proposed for the recycling of 
plastics into H2 rich gas, achieving a hydrogen conversion efficiency of up to 84.3%. In the experiment, plastic 
was initially decomposed into hydrocarbon volatiles, followed by the gasification reactions in the presence of an 
oxygen carrier under vacuum conditions for 10 min. Subsequently, air was introduced for wax removal and 
oxygen carrier recovery for another 10 min. This study evaluated the chemical looping gasification performances 
of polypropylene using oxygen carriers NiaFebOx with different Ni/Fe molar ratios (0, 1:40, 1:20, 1:10, 3:20, and 
1:5). NiFe 20Ox showed the highest gas yield of 81.3 mmol/g PP with an H2 yield of 46.0 mmol/g PP. Among

microwave power for maximum gas yield and H2 yield. Microwave-assisted heating exhibited high efficiency, 
achieving a heating rate of 450 •C/min at 890 W, with the microwave oven consuming only 0.182 kWh of 
electrical power during the entire experiment. In the chemical looping gasification of various plastics (poly -
propylene, high-density polyethylene, low-density polyethylene, polystyrene, and plastics mixture) over 
NiFe 20Ox under 890 W microwave power, polypropylene yielded the highest gas and H2 production. This study 
provides a novel approach for efficiently recycling plastics, alleviating environmental pollution and contributing 
to energy sustainability.
1.Introduction
Plastic products are ubiquitous in modern society due to their 
affordability, malleability, and convenience, which have made them 
exceedingly popular among consumers. As global demand continues to 
rise, plastic production reached a substantial 400.3 million tonnes 
annually in 2022 [1]. However, their non-biodegradability and pro-
hibitive recycling costs lead to significant environmental pollution and 
pose threats to human health [2]. Plastics o",268,"[ 0.02559173  0.0197596   0.01191296 ... -0.03907153  0.0216995

natural environment, where they can persist for centuries, releasing 
harmful chemicals and microplastics into ecosystems [3]. The most 
widely used types of plastics include polypropylene (PP), low-density 
polyethylene (LDPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and poly-
styrene (PS), collectively constituting approximately 18.9%, 14.1%, 
12.2%, and 5.2% of global plastic production, respectively [1]. This 
study focuses on these four types of plastics.
Gasification emerges as a promising method for recycling plastic 
waste by producing combustible gas [4]. However, the generated gas 
typically has a low heating value due to the inclusion of gasification agents such as air and carbon dioxide [5]. To address this issue, the 
chemical looping gasification method is proposed, wherein a solid ox-
ygen carrier replaces conventional gasification agents [6]. The oxygen 
carrier can be reduced to provide oxygen atoms for the reaction with the 
plastic vapor, generating gas (CxHy MOz → (2x-z) CO (z-x) CO2 
(y/2) H2 M) [7]. Subsequently, the reduced oxygen carrier can be 
regenerated by reacting with air or steam [8]. Metal oxides are 
commonly employed as oxygen",294,"[ 0.03847206  0.04675239  0.01317105 ... -0.01320737  0.01662119

high reactivity in redox reactions, and substantial oxygen storage ca-
pacity [9]. For instance, Yao et al. [7]reported a carbon conversion 
efficiency of 99.03% and a gas production of 177.89 mmol/g PP with a 
lower heating value of 11.35 MJ/Nm3 from the chemical looping gasi-
fication of PP.
Chemical looping gasification of solid wastes typically operates at 
temperatures above 800 •C in an electric heating furnace to achieve high 
carbon conversion efficiency [10]. However, maintaining such high 
temperatures consumes considerable energy as electric heating not only 
heats the feedstocks but also the surrounding air. Microwave-assisted 
heating offers higher thermal efficiency compared to electrical heating 
due to its different heating mechanism [11]. Microwave heating utilizes

dipole rotation, ionic conduction, and interfacial polarization [12]. 
Moreover, materials exhibit varying microwave absorption capabilities 
[13], related to factors like dielectric constant, loss tangent, polarity, 
conductivity, and moisture content [14]. This method directly and 
uniformly heats materials, minimizing energy losses and enhancing 
overall efficiency [15]. Furthermore, microwave heating has a higher 
heating rate, which makes the reactions more vigorous, leading to a 
faster release of volatiles [16], thereby benefiting gas production [17]. 
An et al. [18] explored microwave-assisted chemical looping gasifica -
tion of water hyacinth for syngas production, achieving a cold gas effi-
ciency of 78.66% at 1000 W microwave power. However, research on 
microwave-assisted heating in chemical looping gasification of plastics 
remains absent.
Oxygen carriers played a pivotal role in the chemical looping gasi-
fication process [7], and extensive research has focused on identifying 
suitable oxygen carriers [19]. Ideal oxygen carriers should be cost- 
effective, mechanically stable, and exhibit excellent performance char-
acteristics, including high oxygen transport capacity, high selectivity 
[20], and superior redox properties [21]. Metal oxides, including Ni, Fe, 
Mn, Cu [22], W, V [20] and Co [23], have been investigated extensively 
for chemical looping gasification. Iron-based oxygen carriers, such as 
Fe3O4, offer several advantages, such as abundant lattice oxygen, mul-
tiple oxidation states, and low cost [24]. For example, Xu et al. [25]
investigated the chemical looping gasification of rice husk using Fe3O4 
as the oxygen carrier, achieving a syngas yie",393,"[ 0.03314916  0.02794392 -0.0196504  ... -0.00622014 -0.00194107

biomass. Iron oxides also exhibit favorable microwave absorption 
properties [26], making them compatible with microwave-assisted 
heating in chemical looping gasification. Fan et al. [13] studied the 
microwave heating performance of Fe3O4, achieving an instantaneous 
heating rate of up to 289.2 •C/min at 650 W microwave power, with an 
average heating rate of approximately 125 •C/min up to 1000 •C. 
However, Fe-based oxygen carriers are susceptible to sintering, which 
can negatively impact the gasification process and gas production [22]. To mitigate these challenges, Fe-based oxygen carriers are often modi -
fied with other oxides [27]. Additionally, combining two active metals 
can synergistically enhance catalytic performance beyond that of indi-
vidual metals [28]. For instance, Qiu et al. [29] demonstrated that 
CoFeO x as an oxygen carrier achieved a H2 yield of 11.17 mmol/g in 
chemical looping H2 production from water splitting, surpassing Fe2O3 
(7.61 mmol/g). The synergistic effects of Co doping into Fe2O3, vali-
dated through temperature-programmed reduction analysis, were 
shown to promote the reduction of Fe. Huang et al. [30] examined the 
chemical looping gasification of biomass char using NiFe 2O4, which 
exhibited superior char gasification performance with a carbon con-
version efficiency of 88.12%, significantly higher than that of individual 
Fe2O3 or a mechanical mixture of Fe2O3 and NiO, due to the Fe/Ni 
synergistic effect. Despite these advancements, research on identifying 
oxygen carriers suitable for microwave-assisted heating in chemical 
looping gasification of plastics is lacking.

looping gasification of plastics [7]. Key parameters that influence H2 
yield include reaction temperature, microwave power, oxygen carrier

chemical looping gasification process, as higher temperatures promote 
the cracking of large molecules [8]. Previous studies have demonstrated 
that increasing temperature generally results in higher gas yields and 
greater H2 production [31]. Similarly, higher microwave power leads to 
faster heating, which accelerates the decomposition of plastic waste and 
promotes the release of hydrogen and other volatiles [32]. However, an 
optimal balance must be maintained to avoid issues such as localized 
overheating or inefficient energy use. The selection of a suitable oxygen 
carrier is critical for facilitating the redox reactions in the gasification

In this study, Ni was incorporated onto Fe3O4 through wet impreg -

gasification of plastics was investigated using NiaFebOx as the oxygen

1:20, 1:10, 3:20, and 1:5) and different microwave powers (590 W, 690 
W, 790 W, 890 W, and 990 W) were examined to optimize the Ni/Fe 
molar ratio and microwave power, and to explore their effects on gas 
production. Using NiFe 20Ox with a 1:20 Ni/Fe molar ratio (the optimal 
oxygen carrier) at a microwave power of 890 W (the optimal microwave

Oxygen carriers with different Ni/Fe molar ratios of NiaFebOx were 
synthesized using the wet impregnation method. The preparation pro-
cedure involved dissolving a predetermined quantity of Ni≡

The dried material was then crushed into a powder and calcined in a 
muffle furnace under an oxidative atmosphere at 550 •C for 5 h. Then 
the oxygen carriers were sieved using standard screens, with particle 
sizes ranging from 0.074 to 0.096 mm.2.3. Experimental procedures

a digital thermometer, was employed to measure the temperature of the 
feedstocks. The quartz flask reactor, with a chamber volume of 100 ml, 
was used to contain the feedstocks. At the quartz flask reactor ’s outlet, 
three condensing tubes immersed in an ice-water mixture, were placed 
in series to cool the heavy volatiles and collect the condensable oil. A gas 
bag connected to the outlet of the condensers was used to collect the 
non-condensable gas. Two valves were used to control the reactor 
environment by opening and closing as needed.
Each experiment was repeated at least twice to ensure data repro -
ducibility. Throughout the study, 1-g plastic, 6-g oxygen carrier, and 12- 
g SiC were fixed based on the pre-experiments. SiC possessed excellent 
microwave absorption ability and was used to absorb and convert more 
microwaves into heat to improve thermal efficiency. The experiment 
was divided into two stages: the vacuum stage and the air introduction 
stage. In the vacuum stage, the condensers, thermocouple, quartz 
straight tube, quartz flask reactor, and connecting tubes were initially 
weighed. The plastic particles, oxygen carriers, and SiC were weighed 
separately, then mixed uniformly and placed in the quartz flask reactor. 
The experimental system was connected as shown in Fig. 1, with insu-
lation cotton filled in the microwave oven to reduce heat loss. Valve 1 
was turned off and valve 2 was turned on. The experimental system was 
vacuumed with a vacuum pump for ten minutes. Then valve 2 was 
turned off and the vacuum pump was replaced with a gas bag. The mi-
crowave oven was started at the designed microwave power. When the

observed in the SEM images in Fig. 2, thereby inhibiting the catalytic

the CO yield decreased slightly. Due to the addition of the oxygen car-
rier, the gas yield (81.3 mmol/g PP) and H2 yield (46.0 mmol/g PP) 
improved significantly compared with the microwave pyrolysis of PP at 
900 •C, which produced 21.8 mmol/g PP gas and 1.1 mmol/g PP H2 [43]. 
However, the obtained gas yield and H2 yield were lower than those 
from chemical looping gasification of PP with steam introduced (gas 
yield 129.90 mmol/g PP, H2 yield 95.23 mmol/g PP) [7], as steam 
significantly enhanced the gas production while reducing oil yield (CyHz

lower in this study, the absence of steam simplified the experimental 
system and reduced energy consumption. Additionally, steam was 
typically introduced with the inert carrier gas to ensure uniform distri -
bution [45], which diluted the produced gas, thereby reducing its 
quality and HHV values.

H2 concentration obtained at a Ni/Fe molar ratio of 1:20. The increase in 
the loaded Ni ratio led to an increase in active sites; however, excessive 
Ni aggregated and blocked the active sites of Fe3O4 [42]. Without the 
incorporation of Ni, the CO concentration was the highest, due to the 
reactions of hydrocarbon volatiles with the oxygen carrier (R2). Addi-
tionally, fewer H atoms were released, resulting in the highest concen -
trations of CH4 and C2H4. As shown in Fig. 4(c), the gas HHV ranged 
from 15.1 to 21.0 MJ/Nm3. The lowest gas HHV was obtained with 
NiFe 5Ox, due to the high concentration of CO2. The highest HHV was 
obtained with the incorporation of NiFe 40Ox, due to the highest con-
centrations of C3H6, which had high heating values [46]. The heating 
value of gas obtained in this study was higher than that reported in most 
studies on the gasification of plastics (9.5–15.46 MJ/Nm3), even after 
removing inert carrier gases in gas like N2 or Ar [7,47] .
Fig. 4(d) shows the carbon and hydrogen conversion efficiencies at 
the vacuum stage, air introduction stage, and throughout the entire 
experiments. The carbon and hydrogen conversion efficiencies for the 
entire experiments varied within the ranges of 55.4 –70.8% and

hydrogen conversion efficiencies varied within the ranges of

mainly decomposed during the vacuum stage, and the vacuum condi -
tions in this stage led to a high oil yield [13]. During the vacuum stage, 
as the temperature increased to approximately 350–450 •C [48], large

3.3. Effect of microwave power
Microwave power influenced the chemical looping gasification 
process by altering the heating rate and microwave density [15], 
thereby affecting gas production. Therefore, it was necessary to detail 
the effect of microwave power on gas production. Experiments were 
conducted under microwave powers of 590 W, 690 W, 790 W, 890 W, 
and 990 W separately to optimize the microwave power. NiFe 20Ox was 
used as the oxygen carrier due to its best gas yield and H2 yield based on 
Section 3.2. The obtained results are shown in Fig. 5.
3.3.1. Microwave heating performances
Fig. 5(a) shows the microwave heating performances of the feed-
stocks using NiFe 20Ox as oxygen carrier under different microwave 
powers (590 W, 690 W, 790 W, 890 W, and 990 W). The temperature of 
the feedstocks increased from room temperature to 900 •C in 1.5–8 min, 
with heating rates ranging from 112.5 to 600 •C/min. The microwave 
power of 990 W achieved the highest heating rate, while 590 W ach-
ieved the lowest. It should be noted that higher microwave power did 
not necessarily mean higher electricity consumption. Table 2shows t",605,"[ 0.01248615 -0.00024939 -0.02079997 ... -0.02184922  0.01000497

energy consumption of the microwave oven at different microwave 
powers, ranging from 0.182 to 0.293 kWh. The highest energy con-
sumption was recorded at 590 W, while the lowest was observed at 890 
W. The reason could be attributed to the fact that lower microwave 
power required a longer time to heat the feedstocks to 900 •C, resulting 
in higher energy consumption.
3.3.2. Products distribution
Fig. 5(b) shows the H2 yield, CO yield, and gas yield obtained from 
the chemical looping gasification of PP using NiFe 20Ox as the oxygen 
carrier under different microwave powers. The oil yield is shown in 
Table 1. The gas yield and oil yield varied within the ranges of 
41.9 –81.3 mmol/g PP and 23.3 –42.9 wt.%, respectively. The H2 yield and 
CO yield varied within the ranges of 6.2–46.0 mmol/g PP and 25.4 –29.6 
mmol/g PP, respectively. When the microwave power increased from 
590 W to 890 W, the gas yield increased. However, when the microwave 
power was further increased to 990 W, the gas yield decreased while the 
oil yield reached its highest level. Microwave power primarily affected 
gas yield by influencing the heating rate. As shown in Fig. 5(a), higher 
microwave power led to an increased heating rate, which was closely 
linked to heat and mass transfer within the plastics, as well as the resi-
dence time of the volatiles [32]. As the heating rate increased, the PP 
underwent rapid cracking, generating a significant amount of small 
volatile compounds. More of these volatiles escaped the reactor before 
undergoing secondary reactions, such as the recombination of small W. Fu et al.

when the heating rate became excessively high, the volatiles were 
released too quickly, leaving insufficient time for complete cracking. 
Consequently, some volatiles escaped before being converted into gas 
products, leading to a reduction in gas yield [52]. The H2 yield initially 
increased and then decreased with the increase in microwave power, 
while the CO yield changed slightly. At 590 W, the H2 yield was only 6.2 
mmol/g PP. This was attributed to the lower heating rate, which resulted 
in a longer residence time and promoted the recombination reactions of 
small molecules [51]. As the microwave power increased, the higher 
heating rate reduced the recombination reactions of small molecules,

chemical looping gasification of PP using NiFe 20Ox as the oxygen carrier 
under different microwave powers. The volume concentrations of H2,

the oxygen carrier, leading to the generation of large amounts of CO and 
CO2. As the microwave power increased, more smaller hydrocarbons 
generated in the reactors at high temperatures reacted with the oxygen 
carrier (R2) [47], producing a similar amount of CO but less CO2 due to 
insufficient oxygen. The highest gas yield was observed at 890 W, 
resulting in the lowest CO concentration. As shown in Fig. 5(c), the gas 
HHV ranged from 13.3 to 16.1 MJ/Nm3. The lowest gas HHV was ob-
tained at 590 W due to the highest concentration of CO2. The highest 
HHV was obtained at 890 W due to the lowest concentration of CO2.

production due to the lower production of CH4, C2H4, and C3H6, which 
could react with the oxygen carrier (R2), and the highest hydrogen

3.4. Effect of plastic types
NiFe 20Ox was recognized as the optimal oxygen carrier, and 890 W 
was found to be the most effective microwave power for maximizing gas 
yield. These parameters were utilized to investigate the chemical loop-
ing gasification performance of various plastics. Four prevalent plastics, 
representing 50.4 wt.% of global plastic production, including PP, 
HDPE, LDPE, and PS, were selected to examine their microwave-assisted 
chemical looping gasification performances [1]. LDPE and HDPE were 
derived from ethylene; however, LDPE had an irregular structure with 
numerous side chains, while HDPE had an almost linear structure with 
few side chains",212,"[ 0.0374324   0.01757695  0.01522334 ... -0.02962042  0.01142377

featured a linear structure with a phenyl group ( C6H5) on each

NiFe 20Ox mixed with various plastics under a microwave power of 890

significantly decreased compared to the average value (70.0 mmol/ 
gPlastic) of the different plastics, while the oil yield (44.7 wt.%) signifi -
cantly increased compared to the weighted average value (30.1 wt.%). 
This was attributed to secondary reactions occurring in the generated 
vapors between the different plastics [53], resulting in a higher oil yield. 
These average values were calculated based on the weight percentages 
of different plastics in the MP.
3.4.2. Gas compositions
Fig. 6(c) shows the gas components and gas HHV obtained from the 
chemical looping gasification of different plastics using NiFe 20Ox as the 
oxygen carrier under a microwave power of 890 W. The volume con-
centrations of H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H4, and C3H6 varied within the 
ranges of 30.7 –56.5%, 31.3 –56.7%, 4.8–13.1%, 1.1–2.4%, 2.0–2.4%, 
and 0.4–2.8%, respectively. PS showed the highest CO concentration 
and the lowest H2 concentration among different plastics, attributed to 
the difficulty in breaking benzene rings [56]. The carbon and hydrogen 
atoms in the gas mainly originated from the ethylene side chains of 
styrene, which contained fewer hydrogen atoms, resulting in the lowest 
H2 concentration. HDPE and LDPE had similar H2 concentrations, while 
HDPE showed a higher CO concentration. MP exhibited the highest CO 
concentration, which was due to the largest amounts of heavy molecules 
flowing out and the residues reacting with the surplus oxygen carrier 
(R2), leading to the highest CO concentration. As shown in Fig. 6(c), the 
gas HHV ranged from 12.7 to 16.1 MJ/Nm3. The lowest gas HHV was

the entire experiment varied within the ranges of 27.0 –67.8% and 
28.5 –84.3%, respectively. During the vacuum stage, the carbon and 
hydrogen conversion efficiencies varied within the ranges of 
18.3 –57.4% and 22.3 –78.3%, respectively. PS achieved the lowest car-
bon and hydrogen conversion efficiencies, due to its highest oil yield (70

hydrogen conversion efficiency compared to LDPE, due to its more 
regular molecular chains, which required higher temperatures or longer 
reaction times for complete cracking [57], making it more likely to

3.5. Result comparisons
Table 3presents the experimental results for gas production from the 
pyrolysis and gasification of PP, along with the findings of this study. 
The optimal gas yield in this study was 81.3 mmol/g PP (1.15 g/gPP), 
achieved using NiFe 20Ox as the oxygen carrier at a microwave power of 
890 W and a reaction temperature of 900 •C. In comparison to electrical 
air gasification of PP, the gas yield in this study was lower (1.15 g/gPP vs. 
1.66 g/gPP) [59], which can be attributed to the slower release rate of 
lattice oxygen [60]. However, the H2 concentration in this study was 
significantly higher (56.5 vol.% vs. 11.2 vol.%) due to the catalytic ef-
fect of NiFe 20Ox. In air gasification, the introduction of air diluted the generated gas, leading to a lower heating value of 7.92 MJ/Nm3 
compared to 16.1 MJ/Nm3 in this study [59]. Similarly, microwave- 
assisted gasification of PP produced a lower H2 concent",454,"[ 0.01796949 -0.00509883 -0.0084444  ... -0.0240513   0.01609551

heating value [61]. The H2 concentration observed in this study (56.5 
vol.%) was slightly lower than that reported for PP pyrolysis (59.0 vol. 
%), likely due to the use of a more complex catalyst in the pyrolysis 
process and the oxidation of lattice oxygen in this study [34]. Never -
theless, the gas yield in this study was significantly higher, owing to the 
oxidation of plastic volatiles, which enhanced H2 production. In mi-
crowave pyrolysis of PP without a catalyst, both the gas yield and H2 
concentration were lower than in this study [62].
4.Conclusions
In this study, microwave-assisted heating coupled with chemical 
looping gasification of plastics at 900 •C were investigated, detailing the 
effects of Ni/Fe molar ratio of NiaFebOx oxygen carrier, microwave 
power, and types of plastics on gas production. Investigations first 
screened Ni/Fe molar ratios (0, 1:40, 1:20, 1:10, 3:20, and 1:5) in the 
NiaFebOx oxygen carrier. NiFe 20Ox emerged as the optimal oxygen car-
rier, achieving the highest gas yield of 81.3 mmol/g PP and an H2 yield of 
46.0 mmol/g PP, with a hydrogen conversion efficiency of up to 84.3 %. 
Using Fe3O4 as the oxygen carrier, the highest gas HHV of 21 MJ/Nm3 
and the highest carbon conversion efficiency of 70.9 % were obtained.
Subsequently, the effect of microwave powers (590 W, 690 W, 790 
W, 890 W, and 990 W) on gas production was examined. The gas yield 
first increased then decreased with increasing microwave power, iden-
tifying 890 W as the optimal power. The average heating rate ranged 
from 112.5 to 600 •C/min across the different microwave powers, with 
the electrical power consumption of the microwave oven varying be-
tween 0.182 kWh and 0.293 kWh. Notably, the microwave power of

Using the optimal microwave power of 890 W, the chemical looping 
gasification performances of different plastics over NiFe 20Ox were 
investigated. PP showed the highest gas yield and H2 yield, while HDPE 
exhibited the highest carbon conversion efficiency of 67.8 % and the 
highest CO yield of 38.3 mmol/g Plastic. However, the synergistic effect of 
MP was not conducive to gas production. This was attributed to sec-
ondary reactions occurring in the generated vapors between different 
plastics, resulting in a high oil yield.

system operational in the Qingdao region showed a global warming potential of 1763.5 kgCO 2-eq and an acid-
ification potential of 16.77 kgSO 2-eq. Economic analysis revealed that the system offers substantial economic 
benefits with a return on investment of 11.23 %, a payback period of 6.283 years, and a net present value of 
1.201 ×106 $. The cost of this process significantly undercuts that of renewable hydrogen production, providing 
considerable environmental advantages by effectively utilizing waste resources and reducing waste disposal 
issues. Given its cost-effectiveness and environmental benefits, chemical looping gasification technology for 
hydrogen production from food waste holds wide-ranging future application potential.
1.Introduction
As global population growth continues and urbanization accelerates, 
the production of food waste (FW) has increased dramatically, emerging 
as a significant environmental challenge worldwide (Dhiman and 
Mukherjee, 2021 ). It is estimated that over 1",293,"[ 0.01529658  0.01106972  0.04399538 ...  0.00549942  0.01215221

E:\\PINNs-Research\\Searched Articles\\Process Optimization And Life Cycle Assessment In a 10MWth food waste chemical looping gasification system for hydrogen production.pdf,1,3,".3 billion t of FW are 
generated globally each year. This not only leads to a substantial waste 
of resources but also creates significant environmental issues during 
disposal, such as greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution, and soil 
degradation (Saqib et al., 2019 ). According to relevant statistics, China 
generates approximately 80 million t of FW annually, with an annual 
growth rate of 10 %. Food waste decomposes easily, producing foul 
odors and significantly impacting human health and the environment. 
Due to its high organic content, which accounts for over 90 % of the dry 
matter, and its high moisture content and rich organic composition, the treatment and efficient utilization of FW present increasing challenges 
(Havukainen et al., 2017; Tang et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2014 ). 
Currently, FW is often managed through techniques such as composting, 
anaerobic digestion, incineration, or landfilling (Jin et al., 2021 ). 
However, traditional methods such as landfilling, incineration, and 
anaerobic digestion have limitations in effectively treating FW. The 
options for disposing of waste in landfills are limited due to the scarcity 
of land resources. Incineration requires a considerable amount of addi-
tional fuel and significant financial investment. Anaerobic digestion, on

periods, and the potential to cause environmental damage (Caton et al., 
2010; Chen et al., 2019 ). Therefore, identifying effective techniques for 
the treatment and resource recovery of food waste has become a crucial 
research direction in the fields of environmental protection and sus-
tainable development.

E:\\PINNs-Research\\Searched Articles\\Process Optimization And Life Cycle Assessment In a 10MWth food waste chemical looping gasification system for hydrogen production.pdf,2,1,"FW gasification is a thermal process that transforms organic waste 
into syngas by exposing it to high temperatures. By using dry FW as a 
fuel source in the gasification process, the organic elements of FW are 
converted into reusable solid byproducts and syngas, primarily 
composed of CO, H2, and CH4. This syngas can be utilized for electricity 
generation, heating, or as a raw material for chemical production 
(Matsakas et al., 2017 ). However, gasification technology presents 
certain drawbacks, including high costs, technical complexity, potential 
environmental pollution (for example, emissions of HCl and H2S), 
stringent pre-treatment requirements for feedstock, and the risk of sec-
ondary pollution from the handling of residuals (Shahabuddin et al., 
2020 ). Compared to traditional FW gasification, Chemical Looping 
Gasification (CLG) offers significant advantages in FW treatment. 
Firstly, CLG employs oxygen carriers (OC) instead of air to supply oxy-
gen, which prevents nitrogen from entering the system, thereby signif -
icantly enhancing the purity and calorific value of the syngas (Yu et al., 
2019 ). Moreover, in the CLG process, OC can be recycled, significantly 
reducing the consumption of auxiliary fuel and operating costs 
(Dieringer et al., 2020 ). Additionally, CLG effectively minimizes the 
production of harmful gases such as HCl and H2S, thereby reducing the 
risk of environmental pollution (Jiang et al., 2022 ). Due to the relatively 
low requirements of CLG for the moisture content and particle size of 
FW, the pre-treatment process is simpler, thereby reducing operational 
complexity and cost (Molino et al., 2016 ) Additionally, the residue 
produced by CLG primarily consists of OC and a small amount of 
non-combustible material. This residue is less toxic and easier to handle, 
further reducing the ri",425,"[-0.02942679  0.03647992  0.03082192 ... -0.00153884 -0.01212337

Therefore, CLG demonstrates significant advantages in enhancing gasi-
fication efficiency, reducing environmental pollution, and simplifying 
operations.
Many researchers have conducted in-depth studies on the resourceful 
treatment of FW. Tanaka et al. (Tanaka et al., 2008 ) were the first to 
explore FW gasification technology using steam as a gasifying agent for 
hydrogen production. The findings indicate that FW gasification is 
highly effective in minimizing the production of residual waste. Ahmed 
et al. (Ahmed and Gupta, 2010 ) conducted a study demonstrating that 
steam gasification of FW is more efficient than the pyrolysis method. 
This technique significantly enhances the production of syngas and 
hydrogen. Although these tests highlight the potential of gasification 
technology in FW treatment, they also reveal limitations. For example, 
these studies did not thoroughly examine the impact of key process 
parameters on gasification technology, leading to relatively idealized 
conclusions.
Xu et al. (Xu et al., 2023 ) conducted an analysis of energy efficiency, 
techno-economics, and environmental impact by integrating plasma 
gasification with chemical looping technology using FW as feedstock. 
The study found that plasma gasification exhibits high energy efficiency 
and low environmental impact, but its substantial cost necessitates a 
careful balance in practical applications. Menacho et al. (Menacho et al., 
2022 ) engaged in simulation modeling and analysis to explore the 
process of biogas production from food waste. They investigated the 
influence of various operational parameters on biogas yield. The results 
indicated that optimizing temperature and pressure significantly affects 
the quantity and quality of biogas produced, providing valuable theo-
retical",382,"[-0.01247554  0.01643821  0.02500108 ... -0.00493771  0.00181414

et al., 2024 ) performed a comprehensive performance analysis 
comparing the co-gasification of food waste and municipal solid waste. 
Their research showed that co-gasifying various types of biomass could 
enhance syngas production and improve the stability and efficiency of 
the gasification process. Ramzan et al. (Ramzan et al., 2011 ) developed a 
steady-state simulation model to accurately simulate the co-gasification 
of multiple biomass sources, including food waste, municipal solid 
waste, and chicken manure. This study used the Gibbs free energy 
minimization technique to assess the impact of various parameters, such 
as temperature, equivalence ratio, biomass moisture content, and steam 
injection, on the composition of syngas, its calorific value, and the efficiency of cold gas production. The findings revealed that higher 
temperatures promote the formation of CO and H2, while higher 
equivalence ratios reduce the synthesis of these gases, leading to 
decreased cold gas efficiency. Currently, the primary focus of resource 
utilization for FW is on the gasification step, yet comprehensive as-
sessments of the CLG process for FW are scarce. This gap complicates the 
quantitative analysis of the environmental and economic impacts of the 
FWCLG process.
The effective transformation of FW into high-quality energy remains 
a crucial field of study. However, most research is still in the experi -
mental phase, and there is a notable lack of publications on process 
modeling, lifecycle assessment, and economic evaluation of FWCLG for 
hydrogen generation. This study uses Aspen Plus software to analyze the

2.Process description and gasification evaluation indicators
In this study, the FWCLC process was simulated using Aspen Plus 
V12. The complete procedure comprises four primary stages: drying, 
pyrolysis, CLG, and separation. The critical phase, CLG, involves 
extracting energy from food waste and converting it into gaseous mol-
ecules. Aspen Plus utilizes various thermodynamic property methods to 
evaluate parameters such as K-values, enthalpy, and density. (Al-Malah, 
2022 ). The simulation adopted a property approach based on conven -
tional components due to the consistency of physical property methods 
for solid components. Given the presence of traditional components 
operating at low pressure, the PENG-ROB property method was selected, 
as it is well-suited for applications in gas processing, refining, and pet-
rochemicals. During the simulation, FW and ash were identified as 
non-traditional constituents. Since they cannot be represented with 
molecular formulae, the HCOALGEN and DCOALIGT models were 
employed to calculate the enthalpy and density of FW and ash. The 
stream type selected was MIXCINC.
To ensure the accuracy of the model, the following assumptions were 
primarily considered: 
1. The FWCLG system operates under absolute pressure and is in a 
steady state.
2. Heat loss within the reactor is neglected",375,"[-0.03076556  0.02773788  0.066093   ... -0.02663814  0.01053578

the drying reactor (DEY) at ambient temperature (25•C, 1bar) to reduce 
its moisture content. The dried product then enters a flash separator 
(SEP-1) to yield streams of dry FW and water vapor. This separator 
operates under standard atmospheric pressure and feed temperature, 
using the thermodynamic principle of flash separation to effectively 
isolate the moisture. Due to the challenges in quantifying the Gibbs free 
energy of FW, it initially undergoes pyrolysis, leading to the separation 
of its elemental components: C, H2, O2, S, N2, and ash. The pyrolysis 
process is simulated using a RYIELD reactor, which transforms uncom -
mon components into conventional ones by determining the component product distribution. This reactor operates at a temperature of 600•C 
and a pressure of 1bar. Subsequently, the degraded substances combine 
with OC and steam in the FR. The reaction occurs at a temperature of

sorption, steam condensation, and heat exchange between hot and cold

nents, CGE, and H2/CO during the hydrogen production process from 
FW in Qingdao as the fuel reactor temperature increases from 750•C to 
950•C. Fig. 3(a) shows that the molar fractions of H2 and CO gradually 
increase with rising temperature, while those of CO2 and CH4 decrease. 
This is because higher temperatures enhance reactions (4) and (5), 
leading to more H2 and CO production. Additionally, at elevated tem-
peratures, CH4 more readily decomposes into H2 and CO (CH 4 H2O →

significantly increases with rising H2O/C. This change is explained by 
the intensified water-gas shift reaction at higher H2O/C, which leads to a 
significant increase in H2 generation and a reduction in CO production, 
thus greatly enhancing the H2/CO. These findings suggest that altering 
the H2O to carbon ratio can significantly affect the outcomes of the 
gasification process, leading to increased H2 production and a more 
favorable syngas composition. However, it is crucial to maintain a 
proper balance between the increase in H2 production and the decrease 
in CGE to enhance the overall efficiency of the gasification process. 
Consequently, a H2O/C of 0.6 is considered optimal.

of CH4 remains relatively stable across the range of O/C. As the O/C 
increases, the molar fractions of CO and H2 decline, indicating that at 
high O/C conditions, more syngas is converted into non-combustible 
CO2 and H2O, leading to an overall reduction in the molar fractions of 
combustible gases.
Fig. 5(b) describes the trends in CGE, Y, and net heat power of the 
system as the O/C varies from 1.0 to 2.0. CGE gradually decreases with 
increasing O/C, a trend consistent with the changes in the molar frac-

complete oxidation reactions, reducing the production of combustible 
gases and thus lowering CGE. Y also decreases with increasing O/C, as 
syngas primarily composed of CO and H2 sees reduced molar fractions of 
both components at higher O/C. Conversely, the net heat power of the 
system gradually increases with higher O/C because more exothermic 
complete oxidation reactions (such as the oxidation of CO to CO2 and H2 
to H2O) occur under high O/C conditions, releasing more heat and 
thereby increasing the system ’s net heat power. Therefore, while higher

3.2.4. Hydrogen production rates in different regions
The composition of FW from various locations may influence 
hydrogen production in the FWCLG process. This section explores the 
impact of differing FW compositions from various regions in China on 
hydrogen output. Table 2presents the breakdown of FW composition 
from these regions, while Fig. 4illustrates hydrogen production varia -
tions in the FWCLG process with different FW compositions. Despite 
these variations, Fig. 4demonstrates that hydrogen concentration in the 
syngas produced by the FWCLG process shows minimal regional varia -
tion. This observed variance can be attributed to geographical factors, 
such as dietary habits, which influence the composition of food waste. 
However, within certain limits, these differences have a negligible 
impact on hydrogen production.
Data from Table 2indicates that the hydrogen content in syngas 
largely depends on the hydrogen content in the FW. In Beijing, the 
hydrogen yield is slightly lower than in Qingdao, attributed to the higher 
carbon content in Beijing ’s FW. This higher carbon content leads to 
increased OC entering the reactor, where excess OC may consume 
additional hydrogen, reducing the hydrogen yield. As expected, regional 
differences in sulfur content in FW contribute to variations in hydrogen

remains fairly consistent across different regions, as starch is a common 
staple. Variations in FW composition is primarily influenced by local 
preferences for side dishes. For instance, Qingdao, a coastal city, has a 
preference for seafood, which significantly increases the sulfur content 
in the FW of the region.
4.Life cycle assessment
In the FWCLG process, several positive environmental impacts are 
generated. However, quantifying the environmental changes caused by 
FWCLG systems in different regions remains a significant challenge. Life 
Cycle Assessment (LCA) serves as a vital tool in this context, providing 
an objective depiction of the environmental impacts of FWCLG systems 
across various regions. The framework set by the International Organi -
zation for Standardization (ISO) categorizes environmental impacts into 
five key areas: global warming, acidification, eutrophication, photo -
chemical ozone production, and particulate matter.

4.1. Definition of goal and scope
The CLG process for FW is a complex procedure involving multiple 
coupled chemical reactions. It encompasses various inputs of production 
materials and consumption of terminal energy and involves the forma -
tion of multiple intermediate products and the output of several prod-
ucts, thus creating a complex product symbiosis system. Therefore,

energy to replace fossil fuels. This includes a comprehensive analysis of 
the entire life cycle of the product, focusing on clean energy utilization, greenhouse gas emissions, and other environmental impact factors. The

14040 standard requirements (Klüppel, 2005 ), the analysis is conducted 
using Ecochain LCA software. The system boundary is established based 
on the European Union Product Environmental Footprint guidelines, 
which suggest excluding processes whose material, energy, and envi-
ronmental significance do not exceed 3%. The system boundary is 
illustrated in Fig. 7.
Assuming a 25 years operational lifespan for the system, the envi-

the CLG plant is relatively limited and can be considered negligible 
when compared to the duration of the entire operational period.

such as plant construction, equipment manufacturing, and installation 
are excluded based on the cut-off criteria. Furthermore, greenhouse gas 
emissions and energy consumption during the production of construc -
tion materials and infrastructure development are also excluded from 
the environmental impact calculations.
The ash resulting from the FW is collected and transported to a 
landfill, while the airborne particles and smoke are categorized as fly ash 
and ashes. Once the system boundary is established, it becomes neces -
sary to define the functional unit of the system to facilitate the subse -
quent life cycle inventory analysis. Inventory data are then adjusted 
according to the functional unit to determine the energy consumption 
and environmental emission intensity indicators for the entire process.

of 1t of FW.

From Table 5, it is evident that when processing 1t of FW, the 
FWCLG process in Qingdao yields relatively higher amounts of H2S, 
COD, and VOC compared to the process in Beijing. As a coastal city, 
Qingdao’s higher seafood consumption contributes to the generation of 
more organic compounds and pollutants during gasification. 
Conversely, the PM10 produced by the FWCLG process in Qingdao is 
lower than that in Beijing, which significantly mitigates smog condi -
tions. This indirectly suggests that Beijing experiences more smog from 
waste incineration compared to Qingdao.

data are provided in Table 6.
Chemicals such as CO2, CH4, NOx, and CO all have the potential to 
trigger global warming, measured in kilograms of carbon dioxide 
equivalent (kgCO 2-eq). The GWP values of FWCLG in Qingdao and Bei-
jing reach 1763.5 and 1956.27 kgCO 2-eq, respectively. Among the global 
warming effects, CO emissions produce the most significant impacts, 
followed closely by CO2. Compared to CO and CO2, the overall impact of 
CH4 and NOx on global warming is more limited, mainly because this 
model treats a functional unit of 1t of FW instead of syngas.
Regarding environmental acidification, chemicals such as SO2, NOx, 
H2S, HCl, and HF have the potential to cause this phenomenon. Acidi -
fication values are described in terms of kilograms of sulfur dioxide

5.4. Economic indicator
The FCI, WC, and TCI are assessed using the percentages shown in 
Table 12, which are derived from the equipment investment. The FCI 
value is 3.25×106 $, the WC value is 1.069×106 $, and the TCI value 
is 0.1545×106 $. Based on the assumptions provided in Table 8, we 
have calculated the TPC and the production cost of H2. The results of 
these calculations are shown in Table 12. The TPC of H2 is $1.118×106 
per year, whereas the cost of producing one kilogram of H2 is $2.104. 
The ROI, PBP, and NPV are computed using Eqs. (4) and (6). The ROI is 
11.23 %, the PBP is 6.283 years, and the NPV is 1.201×106 $.
Additionally, the distribution of hydrogen production costs is illus-
trated in Fig. 9. Maintenance and operation costs account for the largest 
proportion of these costs, at 38.3 %. Therefore, it is essential to formu -
late and implement a preventive maintenance plan, which includes 
regular inspections and upkeep of equipment. This approach helps 
detect and address potential issues promptly, thereby avoiding high

6.Conclusion
The study utilized Aspen Plus process simulation software to model a 
10MW th FWCLG hydrogen production system. A sensitivity analysis 
was performed to determine the most favorable settings for the system. 
Additionally, a comprehensive examination of the technology lifetime 
and economic analysis was conducted to systematically evaluate its 
viability and benefits in real-world applications. The primary findings 
can be summarized as follows: 
(1) The gasification process was elucidated by analyzing the impact 
of various operating factors using Aspen Plus software simula -
tion. According to the study, when the temperature of the FR is 
850•C, the H2O/C is 0.6, and the O/C is 0.45, the system achieves 
an H2/CO of 1.718, a Y of 1.209 m3/kg, and a CGE of 51.78 %.",203,"[-0.03013719 -0.00683329  0.02337969 ... -0.0304656   0.02730788

1763.5 kgCO 2-eq and 16.77 kgSO 2-eq. Although the gasification of 
FW in Qingdao results in increased generation of certain pollut -
ants, the overall environmental impact is minimal. CLG tech-
nology is deemed more appropriate for waste treatment in 
Qingdao, facilitating efficient resource utilization and environ -

economic aspects of the 10MW th FWCLG hydrogen generation 
system. The findings demonstrate that the system yields favorable 
economic advantages, with a ROI of 11.23 %, a PBP of 6.283

Hydrogen is an important energy carrier which could meet 
the sustainable development of both the resource and 
environment. The industrial processes of H 2 production 
mainly consist of coal gasification, steam methane reforming, and water electrolysis
[1–3]. However, H 2 production from these 
processes presents several draw backs. For example, the coal 
gasification has the disadvantages of high investment, long process flow, and low efficiency
[4]. The steam methane 
reforming is also restricted by several factors including 
limited resource, vast water consumption, and severe 
requirements of equipment material. The energy cost of water electrolysis for H
2 production is too large. Therefore, it is 
important to explore an efficient and reasonable way for H 2 
production from consideration of environment protection and reasonable resource utilization.

environment protection and energy conversion efficiency in comparison with other processes. The simulation result of 
Aspen Plus revealed that the chemical looping hydrogen process from coal is superior to that from syngas in efficiency 
and equipment investment. The hot efficiency of chemical 
looping for hydrogen production by using coal could reach 78%, which was 30% higher than that of hydrogen production 
from coal gasification. Besides, this process could capture 90% 
of carbon dioxide
[5]. Yang et al[9] tried to evaluate the 
chemical looping for hydrogen production with a fluidized 
bed reactor. The result showed that iron-based oxygen carriers 
could meet the requirements of chemical looping for hydrogen production, but the process efficiency was not high. The 
moving bed reactor was more suitable for this process 
proposed by Fan et al
[6], by which Fe 2O3 is reduced to FeO 
and Fe, and the concentration of CO 2 is very high in outlet for 
cheap capturing. However, few experimental data were provided to validate the simulation results.

Firstly, Fe 2O3 is reduced to FeO and Fe by coal char in 
reduction reactor. Secondly, FeO and Fe are oxidized to Fe 3O4 
by steam in oxidation reactor, releasing H 2 at the same time. 
Finally, oxygen carrier is oxidized back to Fe 2O3 by air in 
combustion reactor. The main reactions are shown as 
following equations of (1) – (5):

iron-based oxygen carrier in chemical looping based on our 
previous work
[10–13]. It can be found that the reaction rate 
increased greatly with the addition of K 2CO 3, in fact the 
reaction (C + CO 2  2CO) was promoted by K 2CO 3. Thus, 
K2CO 3 was proved to be an efficient catalyst. Yu et al[13] 
conducted a more detailed study on the mechanism of 
chemical looping for gasification, but there is no data 
provided about the gas concentration in every section and the phase change in hydrogen production. 
In this work, the effects of temperature and feed ratio on 
coal char direct chemical looping for hydrogen production with an Fe-Zr oxygen carrier modified by K
2CO 3 was comprehensively studied. In addition, the cycle performance of oxygen carrier was also investigated to provide foundation for the development of chemical looping gasification process.

E:\\PINNs-Research\\Searched Articles\\Recent progresses in catalytic tar elimination during biomass gasification.pdf,2,1,"1. Introduction
The contribution of biomass to the world’s energy supply is
presently estimated to be around 10% to 14% [1]. Biomass
gasiﬁcation is an interesting technology in the future develop-
ment of a worldwide sustainable energy system, which can help
to decrease our current dependence on fossil fuels. Biomass
gasiﬁcation is a thermal process where solid fuel is converted
into a useful gas using several gasifying agents such as air, and
steam. The producer gas has a great number of applications. The
most important is being combustion for power and heat genera-
tion as well as raw gas for production of fuels or chemicals [2].
However, gasiﬁcation of biomass produces not only useful fuel
gases but also some unwanted byproducts. Among them, tar is
recognized as one of the most problematic parameters in any
gasiﬁcation system [3,4]. These tars can cause several problems,
such as cracking in the pores of ﬁlters, forming coke and plugging
them, and condensing in the cold spots and plugging them,
resulting in serious operational interruptions [5]. Moreover, these
tars are dangerous because of their carcinogenic character, and
they contain signiﬁcant amounts of energy that can be transferred
to the fuel gas as H",283,[0.00194699 0.04730725 0.02816183 ... 0.01411568 0.00884838 0.01659578]

of tars can damage or lead to unacceptable levels of maintenance
for engines and turbines. Tars are deﬁned as a generic (unspeciﬁc)
term comprising all organic compounds present in the producer
gas excluding gaseous hydrocarbons (C1–C6) and benzene [6].
Fig. 1 shows the typical composition of biomass tars [7]. However,
this composition depends on the type of fuel and the gasiﬁcation
process.
In general, tars can be removed by physical, noncatalytic (e.g.,
thermal cracking), and catalytic tar elimination processes [8].
Various mechanical/physical gas cleanup systems exist for
removal of both particulates and tar from gases produced bybiomass gasiﬁcation. Often these overlap, particularly when tar is
present as liquid droplets. Based on application, mechanical/
physical methods are divided into two categories: dry and wet
gas cleaning. Dry gas cleaning is usually used prior to gas cooling
where the temperature is greater than 500 1C and partly below
200 1C after gas cooling, while wet gas cleaning is used after the
gas cooling and typically about 20–60 1C[9]. A summary of
particles and tar reduction from producer gas in various mechan-
ical/physical methods are as",295,"[-0.02688219  0.02478587  0.05317247 ...  0.01411931  0.01370005

E:\\PINNs-Research\\Searched Articles\\Recent progresses in catalytic tar elimination during biomass gasification.pdf,2,3,"shown in Table 1 [10] . Physical
methods involve ﬁlters and scrubbers, where the tar is separated
in a condensed form. However, a great disadvantage of thisstrategy is that the crude synthesis gas needs to be cooled down
before the ﬁnal separation. Furthermore a huge amount of waste
water is produced. In addition to that tar can be removed
thermally. Thereby temperature from over 1000 1C is required
to remove the undesired components completely [11].
From an economic and technical point of view the catalytic
process therefore is a promising alternative. Great advantage of
this strategy is that a high degree of purity can be achieved at low
temperature and simultaneous increase of the fuel value [11].
Depending on the experimental conditions, catalytic methods can
be classiﬁed into reforming, cracking, hydrogenation and selective
oxidation. To meet the demands of an energy efﬁcient process, a
tar removal strategy in the temperature range from 350 1Ct o
700 1C is desirable. From both the outlet temperature of the
gasiﬁcation process (900–1300 1C) and the operating temperature

the already mentioned problems which fulﬁlls the requirements
is the catalytic partial oxidation. The addition of a small amount
of oxygen (stoichiometric towards tar) causes an efﬁcient tar
reduction to a fuel gas based on CO/H
2. A special challenge is
indeed the choice of the catalyst, since the tar needs to be
removed without oxidizing the synthesis gas components. The
general catalytic tar removal strategy is shown in Fig. 2 [11] .
Catalytic tar conversion is a technically and economically
interesting approach for gas cleaning. Such an approach is

conversion efﬁciencies while simultaneously eliminating the need
for the collection and disposal of tars. The catalytic conversion
of tars is commonly known as hot gas cleaning. The research
on catalytic tar conversion involves two methods [12,13]: One
approach involves incorporating or mixing catalyst with the feed
biomass to achieve so called catalytic gasiﬁcation or pyrolysis
(also called in situ). This method is a one of the primary methods
used for tar reduction, where the tar is removed in the gasiﬁer
itself. In the second approach, the gasiﬁer producer gas is treated
downstream of the gasiﬁer in a secondary reactor. This method is
a one of the secondary methods used for tar reduction, where the
tar is removed outside the gasiﬁer. Among hot gas conditioning
systems, catalytic cracking and steam reforming of high molecu-
lar weight hydrocarbons offer several advantages, such as thermal
integration and high tar conversion. A large number of investiga-
tions deal with biomass gasiﬁcation in ﬂuidized bed reactors
utilizing nickel based catalysts, dolomite or olivine.
This article presents, in detail, the recent works on the
catalytic tar elimination after biomass gasiﬁcation. Widely used
catalysts like Ni-based catalysts, olivine, dolomite etc. are intro-
duced, and novel developed like nano-Ni-based catalysts, ceramiccatalysts are also recommended here. Then,",346,"[-0.0127563  -0.00667395  0.02161792 ...  0.02972772  0.00615322

2. Catalytic tar elimination
Tar elimination reactions are known to be kinetically limited.
Therefore, the reaction rates can be increased by increasing the
temperature and/or using a catalyst. However, catalysts can only
increase the rate of a reaction that is thermodynamically feasible.
The chemistry involved in catalytic tar decomposition of producer
gas is a complex mix of hydrocarbon decomposition and equili-
brium reactions. The tar reaction mechanisms have been inves-
tigated, for example, by Simell et al. [14], by using toluene as a tar
component in hot catalytic gas cleanup. Based on these toluene
experiments, they proposed a set of decomposition and equili-
brium reactions (1), (6) and (8) summarized in Table 2 . The
proposed reaction scheme is complemented by reaction (7).I n
Table 2 , toluene is replaced by C
nHm, which is a general repre-
sentation of the tar molecules in the producer gas from a biomass
gasiﬁer. In comparison to toluene, the tar composition in a gasiﬁer
includes at least 150 different tar molecules, which vary in
molecular weights from that of benzene to weights higher than
pyrene. As the molecular weight of the tars is increased so is
usually also the dew point temperature, which normally increasesthe operating problems. In addition to",340,"[-0.01613008  0.00920234  0.01258366 ...  0.00448499  0.02125404

tar components, reaction (1), studies have shown that steam and
dry reforming reactions (1)and (6) are catalyzed by metals from
group VIII [14,15]. This implies that the Fe content of the ilmenite,
together with the water and carbon dioxide content in the
producer gas, will induce both steam and dry reforming.Calculations performed by Simell et al. [14] showed that dry
reforming was more thermodynamically favored than steam
reforming reactions at temperatures above 830 1C. Three exother-
mic carbon forming reactions that are favored below 650 1C are
listed in Table 2 ; the Boudouard reaction (14) and two water gas

Fig. 3 . This method combines the ﬁltration for particles removal
and catalytic cracking of tar from producer gas in one step. A great
amount of experimental results demonstrated that the method is
also considerably efﬁcient in removing tar and particles [17–20].

2.1. Ni based catalysts2.1.1. Common Ni catalysts (unitary or binary)
Ni-based catalysts are extensively applied in the petrochem-
ical industry for naphtha and methane reforming [23–39]. Mean-
while, a wide variety of Ni-based catalysts are commercially
available. Especially, some studies showed that nickel based
catalysts had the ability of reversing ammonia reaction, thus it
is possible to reduce NO
xemission during biomass gasiﬁcation
[23–25].
Zhang [30] investigated tar catalytic destruction in a tar
conversion system consisting of a guard bed and catalytic reactor.
Three Ni-based catalysts (ICI46-1, Z409 and RZ409) were proven
to be effective in eliminating heavy tars ( 499% destruction
efﬁciency). Hydrogen yield was also improved by 6–11 vol% (dry
basis). The experimental results also demonstrated that space
velocity had little effect on gas compositions, while increasing
temperature boosted hydrogen yield and reduced light hydro-
carbons (CH 4and C 2H4) formation, which suggested that tar
decomposition was controlled by chemical kinetics.
Coll [34] studied the model compounds like benzene, toluene,
naphthalene, anthracene, and pyrene were cracked using two com-
mercial nickel catalysts: UCG90-C and ICI46-1 at 700–800 1C.
The order of these model tars reactivity was: benzene 4toluene 4
anthracene 4pyrene 4naphthalene. Toluene conversion rate ranged
from 40% to 80% with the ICI46-1 catalyst, and 20% to 60% for the UCI
G90-C catalyst, respectively.

various gas atmospheres at 900 1C and 0.5–20 MPa. The effects of
sulfur poisoning on the activity of these catalysts for tar and
ammonia decomposition had also been evaluated.
Nickel supported on silica was active for tar catalyst cracking at
relatively low temperature (823 K) was described by Zhang [43].
However, these catalysts only maintained their activities for a short
time because of accumulating large amounts of carbon on their
surfaces. Aznar [44] and Baker [45] also mentioned the phenomena
in their experiments. In order to overcome the shortcoming of
the commercial Ni-based catalyst, many Ni-based catalysts were
developed.
The result of Marino [46] indicated that the addition of Ni into
Cu/Ni/ g-Al2O3catalyst was favorable to gases yield increase and
acetic acid production reduction during ethanol gasiﬁcation.
Magnesium, lanthanum, and titanium oxide-doped Ni–Cr/Al 2O3
catalysts were prepared by Denis [47], and experiments were
performed to assess the performance of these catalysts in steam
reforming naphthalene. The experimental results revealed that
the improved catalyst could promote conversion efﬁciency of
naphthalene. After the structure analysis, it was found that MgO
had a signiﬁcant effect on the robustness of catalyst due to the
formation of MgAl 2O4spinel phase.
Courson et al. [48–50] also developed a new Ni based catalyst
by impregnating nickel oxide on olivine and calcination at 900 1C,
1100 1C and 1400 1C. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron micro-
scopy and transmission electron microscopy coupled to energy
dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis showed that there were
interactions between the precursor and the support, which was
consistent with the conclusion of Denis. After the characteristic
studies, the catalyst performance tests indicated that the catalystcontaining 2.8 wt% Ni calcined at 1100 1C was the optimum
catalyst. Furthermore, no sinter",473,"[-0.00529206 -0.02005658 -0.00747149 ... -0.0050551  -0.01859388

Chen [51] investigated CO 2reforming methane over NiO/
g-Al2O3catalyst in a ﬁxed/ﬂuidized bed. Francisco [52] also
compared the Ni catalyst supported on a-Al2O3, ZrO 2and
a-Al2O3–ZrO 2, and found Ni/ a-Al2O3–ZrO 2catalyst showed better
performance. In the literature of Engelen [53], he mentioned that
the 1 wt%/0.5 wt% nickel/calcium catalyst co-precipitated inside
porous ﬁlter discs can effectively remove tar ( 498%) even in the
presence of 100 ppm H 2S.
Recently, some researchers have tried the additive modiﬁca-
tion methods to improve the supported nickel catalysts property
to achieve optimizing utilization. As the aforementioned, Ni is
more suitable than Co in the steam reforming of hydrocarbons
[54–59]. On the other hand, supported Co catalysts have recently
been utilized for the steam reforming of oxygenates such as
ethanol [60], and methanol [61], and it has been reported that
Co is more effective to the steam reforming of oxygenates than Ni
[62–65]. Therefore, in order to obtain high performance in the
steam reforming of tar, catalysts should have high activity for
both hydrocarbons and oxygenates. Development of supported
metal catalysts for the steam reforming of tar derived from
biomass pyrolysis has been carried out mainly by the modiﬁca-
tion of catalytically active element with co-catalysts, such as
modiﬁcation of Ni with CeO 2[66–70], MnO x[71], and Fe [72] and
modiﬁcation of Rh with CeO 2[73–76]. Wang et al. [77] got
research on the synergistic effect of the combination of two
active elements, Ni and Co. The results presented that in the
steam reforming of toluene, Co/Al 2O3showed higher activity and
higher resistance to coke deposition than Ni/Al 2O3, and the
performance of Ni–Co/Al 2O3was located between that of Co/
Al2O3and Ni/Al 2O3. Catalyst characterization indicates the for-

Recently iron-based catalyst and additive Fe attracted more
attention of researchers [78]. Liu studied the different additives
(Fe, Mg, Mn, Ce) on catalytic cracking of biomass tar over Ni 6/
palygorskite [79–81]. Liu [79] found that the effect of additives
(Fe, Mg, Mn, and Ce) on a 6%Ni/PG catalyst was different. Among

compared with that of Mg, Mn, and Ce. Tar conversion and H 2
yield were 98.2% and 56.2%, respectively, when the Fe loading wasincreased to 8%. Fe–Ni alloy and Fe–Ni spinel were found on the
6%Ni/PG catalyst modiﬁed by Fe, which enhanced the catalyst
activity for breaking C–C and C–H bonds, increased carbon
deposition and H

the active components of Fe and Ni.
Liu[80] also investigated catalytic cracking of tar derived from
rice hull gasiﬁcation over palygorskite-supported Fe and Ni.
Comparing the carbon deposits as shown in Fig. 4 , it is observed
that carbon deposition on Fe x–Ni 6/PG catalysts was higher than
Fe6–Ni y/PG catalysts on the whole. Moreover, the two ﬁgures also
showed the effect of Ni and Fe loading on the hydrogen yieldderived from catalytic cracking biomass tar. It is seen that high
concentration of iron can improve the conversion of carbon and
high concentration nickel was more favorable for the increase in
yield of hydrogen. Obviously, it indicates that the addition of Ni
played a more important role in decreasing carbon deposit
compared with Fe. As well known, carbon deposit would decreaseY. Shen, K. Yoshikawa / Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 21 (2013) 371–392 374",516,"[ 0.01400751 -0.02865121 -0.01989226 ...  0.0034962   0.00201649

2.2. Olivine catalysts
A large number of investigations deal with biomass gasiﬁca-
tion in ﬂuidized bed reactors utilizing nickel based catalysts,
dolomite or olivine. Supported nickel-based catalysts with varioussupports and promoters have been the most widely studied class
of materials. The high activity and selectivity of those reforming
catalysts is well known [97,98], but they are susceptible to
deactivation from contaminants.
Olivine is a mineral containing magnesium, iron and silicon. In
parallel with this research, some research groups have been
investigating olivine as a tar removal catalyst [99–103] Rapagna /C18
et al. [99] investigated the catalytic activity of olivine and
observed that it has a good performance in terms of tar reduction
and the activity is comparable to calcined dolomite. They
reported more than 90% reduction in average tar content. The
tar amounted 2.4 gm
0/C03compared to 43 gm 0/C03with only sand.

olivine catalyst by impregnation of natural olivine with an excess
of nickel salt solution [101] . The catalyst was then calcined under
air for 4 h at different calcination temperatures of 900–1400 1C.
They reported that this Ni–olivine catalyst is active for dry
reforming of methane.
Olivine consists mainly of silicate mineral in which magne-
sium and irons cations are set in the silicate tetrahedral [99].
Natural olivine is represented by the formula (Mg,Fe) 2SiO 4. The
catalytic activity of olivine for tar elimination can be related to
the magnesite (MgO) and iron oxide (Fe 2O3) contents, where the
latter is much higher in olivine than in dolomite. On this basis, the
reactions involved in tar elimination with olivine should be
similar to those involved in the same process with calcined rocks.
This catalyst is mainly deactivated by the formation of coke,
which covers the active sites and reduces the surface area of the
catalyst. The advantages of this catalyst are its low price (similarly
to dolomite) and high attrition resistance compared to dolomite.
Its mechanical strength is comparable to that of sand, even at high
temperatures. Its performance is therefore better than that ofdolomite in ﬂuidized-bed environments [99].
Olivine shows a slightly lower activity in biomass gasiﬁcation
and tar reforming, but higher attrition resistance than dolomite
[99]. The addition of some metals to olivine can help to increase
its tar reforming activity. In this sense, the tar abatement activity
of a Ni/olivine catalyst was successfully demonstrated in the100 kWth FICFB (dual ﬂuidized bed steam blown biomass gasi-
ﬁer) pilot plant located in Vienna, with an order of magnitude
reduction in the tar content of the product fuel gas [104 ,105]. The
main drawback attributed to the use of Ni is the cost and t",468,"[ 0.00560113 -0.01763203  0.01038786 ...  0.02006953 -0.00399226

environmental and safety measures derived from its toxicity. In
addition, Rauch et al. [106] demonstrated that olivine activity, or
more speciﬁcally olivine activation, depends on its iron oxide
content. In fact, depending on olivine temperature treatment, iron
can be present in the olivine phase, or as iron oxides. Thus, iron
impregnation of natural olivine appears to be very interesting
way to produce in-bed primary catalysts, for both economic and
environmental reasons. Iron does not affect the catalyst cost due
to its low price in comparison to noble metals and nickel thus
markedly reducing catalyst pollution problems.
Virginie [107] studied Fe/olivine on tar removal during
biomass gasiﬁcation in a dual ﬂuidized bed. And the Fe/olivine
catalyst efﬁciency was evaluated in biomass gasiﬁcation in a dual
ﬂuidized bed for the production of a rich syngas and with low tar
content. It has been found that Fe/olivine material has a double
effect on tar destruction. On the one hand, it acts as a catalyst for
tar and hydrocarbon reforming. On the other hand, it can act as an
oxygen carrier that transfers oxygen from the combustor to the
gasiﬁer, and part of the oxygen is used to burn volatile com-
pounds [107] . Therefore, an inexpensive and non-toxic Fe/olivine
catalyst is a material suitable for use as a primary catalyst in a
ﬂuidized bed gasiﬁcation of biomass and improves the commonly
used olivine catalytic activity.
Meanwhile, the results indicated that the iron distribution in
the samples after gasiﬁcation shows a balance between the
phases FeO and Fe
3O4, which provide for tar reforming. Those
iron species take place in the redox equations of the water gas
shift reaction (Eqs. (17) and (18) ):

reduced by 16% and tar production per kg of dry ash free (daf.)
biomass by 46%. 10 wt% Fe/olivine characterization after test
shows that the catalyst is fairly stable. As shown in Fig. 10 (B),
H2concentration keeps an almost constant value in tests II–IV,
equal to about 53% by volume (dry, N 2free gas), resulting in an
average enhancement in molar concentration of 36% in compar-

amorphous silica with MgO [114] . Those phases are observed for

The temperature proﬁle recorder (TPR) curve of the catalyst

hydrogen to be reduced to metallic iron (FeO). However, a loss of
iron added on olivine (about 5 wt% of total iron) during ﬂuidiza-

explain the decrease of hydrogen consumption [113] . In conclu-

hand, Ca metal cannot be used as a catalyst at high temperature,

shift reaction, (steam) reforming of methane and C 2hydrocarbons
toward their equilibrium, and reducing the tar (toluene, xylenes,
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons/PAHs, and phenolics). The con-
centration of PAHs and phenolics is reduced to 1.9 g/N m3(below

downstream applications. However, the activity of CaO and MgO

The catalytic activity of calcined dolomite was extensively
investigated in terms of tar reduction [120 –131]. Calcined dolo-
mite catalyst is more active than the un-calcined dolomite for tar
decomposition since its large (internal) surface area and oxide
contents on the surface. Hu et al. [132] compared a calcined
dolomite with an un-calcined dolomite as well as a calcined
olivine and raw olivine as downstream catalysts in steam gasiﬁ-
cation of apricot stone and found that among all the catalysts
tested the calcined dolomite is the most effective catalyst for
increasing the H 2content in the gas.

mite converted 90% PAHs and the total tar amount of 4.0 g/N m3

calcined dolomite in the bed, tar contents below 1 g/N m3can

conversion to gaseous products by an average of 21% over
noncatalytic results at a 750 1C isothermal catalyst bed tempera-
ture using 1.6 cm3dolomite/g of biomass. The iron content in
dolomite was found to promote tar conversion and the water–gas

2.4. Zeolites catalysts
Zeolite, silica–alumina, etc. are the acid catalysts. Zeolites are
crystalline silicates and aluminosilicates linked through oxygen
atoms, producing a three-dimensional network containing channels
and cavities of molecular dimensions [137] . Zeolites are solid
catalysts with the following properties: (1)high surface area,
(2)molecular dimensions of the pores, (3) high adsorption capacity,
(4) partitioning of reactant/produc ts, (5) possibility of modulating
the electronic properties of the active sites, and (6) possibility for
preactivating the molecules by strong electric ﬁelds and molecular
conﬁnement [137] . The acidic properties (Bronsted sites) of zeolites
are depended on the method of preparation, form, temperature of
dehydration, and Si/Al ratio. Th e key properties of zeolites are
structure, Si/Al ratio, particle s ize, and nature of the (exchanged)
cation. These primary structure/composition factors inﬂuence acid-
ity, thermal stability, and overall catalytic activity [8].
Zeolites have been widely used in heterogeneous catalysis
because of their well-deﬁned pore structures and capabilities of
extremely high surface area and surface acidity [138] and the
most used in industrial applications [139] since its commercial
availability [137] . The modiﬁcation of acidic zeolites with dis-
persed metals produces catalysts suitable for hydrogenation and

zene, toluene, naphthalene, and polycyclic aromatics. The cata-
lysts have relatively high tolerance for sulfur compounds in the
context of clean up of gasiﬁcation efﬂuents [139] . In the case of
tar reduction, various kinds of zeolites especially the commercial
catalysts were tested by some researchers [140 –153].
The advantages of zeolites are related to their acidity, better
thermal/hydrothermal stability, better resistance to nitrogen and
sulfur compounds, tendency toward low coke formation, and easy
regenerability. The other advantages with zeolites are their
relatively low-price and the knowledge gained about them from
long experience with their use in ﬂuid catalytic cracking (FCC)units. However, the main disadvantage with these catalysts is the
rapid deactivation because of coke formation [8,142].
Nickel is the most widely used metal for steam reforming
applications due to economic reasons and also has a relatively
high activity compared with Co, Pt, Ru, and Rh [153 ,154]. Utilizing
the advantages of using zeolites and nickel metal mentioned

nickel-supported zeolites as a potential tar removal catalyst. An
increase in the SiO 2/Al2O3ratio corresponds to a decrease in the
acidity [155] . Hence, ZY-5.2 with a SiO 2/Al2O3of 5.2 is more acidic
compared to ZY-80 with a SiO 2/Al2O3of 80. Fig. 13 shows that ZY-
5.2 had the highest activity and SiO 2/Al2O3had the least activity
toward naphthalene conversion. This could be due to the higher
acidity of zeolites compared with amorphous SiO 2/Al2O3. Zeolite
catalysts are more active than amorphous catalysts due to their
higher acidic strength both in terms of their strength and number
of acid sites [156 ,157]. Also, it can be seen that naphthalene
conversion increased from 33% to 55%, with a decrease in SiO 2/
Al2O3from 80 to 5.2 for ZY. This increase can once again be
attributed to the higher acidity of ZY-5.2 compared with ZY-80.
However, naphthalene conversion of Na-chabazite with a SiO 2/
Al2O3of 4.0 was lower than ZY with a SiO 2/Al2O3of 80. This could
be due to the presence of sodium, which neutralizes the acidic

earlier. Since Ni/ZY-5.2 is more acidic, the ability of coke forma-tion is greater compared with Ni/ZY-80.Variation of exit gas composition with the different zeolites
tested is presented in Fig. 14 (B). These gas samples were collected
at the end of the experimental run. These exit gas composition
variations are due to several thermodynamically favorable reac-
tions occurring in series and/or parallel. Fig. 14 (B) shows that the

presence of nickel metal on the zeolites. Since Ni is a good steam
and dry reforming catalyst, naphthalene conversions increase for
Ni/zeolites as shown in Fig. 14 (A). This increase in naphthalene
conversions via Eqs. (19) and (20) might have increased the CO
and H 2content of the exit gas. Moreover, a decrease in the

The required reaction temperatures for effective catalytic tar
reforming range from 750 1C to 850 1C[158 –164]. At this high

Catalytic tar reforming hot gas ﬁlter elements can be produced by

Fe can interact with Co to form Co–Fe alloy, and the synergy between
two components with different o xygen afﬁnity is also expected. On
the other hand, supported Co cata lysts modiﬁed with Fe addition
have been utilized recently for the steam reforming of oxygenates,

Activated carbon (AC) is a non-graphitic, microcrystalline form
of carbon. Its structure is more disordered than that of graphite, and
contains crystallites only a few layers thick and less than 10 nm
wide [193] . The porous areas between the crystallites constitute the
large surface area of the activated carbon. The porosity can vary
from micro",342,"[ 0.00792999 -0.03576159 -0.00287796 ...  0.00199811  0.00309934

(450 nm). These pores contribute to the large internal surface
areas and pore volumes of activated carbons and can range from
250 m2/g to 2500 m2/g and 0.1 ml/g to 1.0 ml/g, respectively
[193 ,194]. Due to their highly porous textural structures ( Fig. 17 )
[195] , activated carbons or charcoals (derived from biomass or coal)
have also been widely used as catalyst supports for conversions of
hydrocarbons and tar cracking, not only because their macropores
and mesopores would greatly improve the dispersion of metal ions,
but facilitate transport of reactant molecules (e.g., toluene, 0.68 nm
molecular size) into the internal surfaces of the catalyst, as
illustrated in Fig. 18 (A). It has been demonstrated that activated
carbon has a high afﬁnity and adsorption selectivity to hydrocarbon
compounds such as asphaltenes [196 ,197] . Particularly the meso-
pores of the activated carbon was thought to play an important role
for effective conversion of heavy hydrocarbon compounds into
lighter fractions, while restricting the carbon/coke formation

solid acid catalysts with respect to the resistance to deactivation by
deposition of coke and heavy metals [194 ,196].
In the experiment of Xu [195] , the Ni–Mo–BAC (biomass
derived activated carbon) catalyst proved to be superior to the
Ni–Mo/BAC in that during the course of hydro-treating Athabasca
vacuum tower bottoms (AVTB), the porous textural structure of
the Ni–Mo–BAC catalysts remained better than that of Ni–Mo/
BAC, leading to a larger total pore volume (0.4 cm3/g) and greater
BET surface area (455 m2/g) for the spent catalyst, compared with
0.12 cm3/g pore volume and 150 m2/g BET surface area for the
spent Ni–Mo/BAC. Furthermore, the TEM measurement for the
fresh catalyst Ni–Mo–BAC indicated the presence of highly dis-
persed nanoparticles (20–50 nm) of Ni, Mo metals, as illustrated
inFig. 18 (B). The highly dispersed metallic nanoparticles in the
highly porous carbon matrix could effectively act as the active
adsorption sites for both the solvent and the polycyclic aromatic
asphaltene compounds, which would promote the Hydro-
deasphalting (HDAs) reactions in accordance with the",298,"[ 0.01579629 -0.01483116 -0.01511215 ... -0.00615725  0.0103415

Abu et al. [198] compared the activity of a biomass char to
other catalysts that are commonly used for tar decomposition,
including calcined dolomite (21 wt% MgO, 30 wt% CaO, 0.2 wt%
Fe2O3), olivine (50 wt% MgO, 42 wt% SiO 2, and 7 wt% Fe 2O3), and a
nickel catalyst (70 wt% NiO, 12 wt% Al 2O3and 7 wt% SiO 2). The
biomass char was produced by pyrolysis of pinewood at 500 1C.
Phenol (8–13 g/N m3) and naphthalene (40 g/N m3or 90 g/N m3)were used as tar models and the tests were carried out in the
presence of CO 2(6 vol%), H 2O (10 vol%) and N 2(balance) at 700 1C
and 900 1C. At 900 1C all the catalysts showed high activities, and
phenol was completely converted. At 700 1C the Ni catalyst had
the highest phenol conversion, and the biomass char was less
active, but still more effective than the olivine. The naphthalene
conversion tests were carried out at a temperature of 900 1C. The
biomass char achieved nearly complete conversion of 90 g/N m3

2.7. Continuous catalytic tar reforming
Although amounts of catalysts have been researched for tar
removal and syngas composition adjustment, the activity of the
catalyst can decline over time, and the catalyst can ﬁnally become
poisoned if it is continuously exposed to species like sulfur, chlorine,
and alkali metals, components which all are present in the raw gas to
some extent [201] . It is also concluded that high tar content involves
carbon formation on the catalytic surfaces, which can cause severe
deactivation of the catalyst after short operating time [201 ,202].
Several approaches to minimize the tendency to form carbon on the
surface of the catalyst are reported in the literature surveyed. For
example, catalyst deactivation as a result of carbon deposits was

ﬂuidized bed. In parallel with secondary catalytic tar cleaning
Seemann et al. [204] reported that the internal catalyst circulation
in a ﬂuidized bed for methanation contributed to keeping the catalyst
free of carbon deposits. The methanation experiments showed that
carbon deposits were formed on the catalyst in the bottom zone of
the bed, and as the catalyst was transported upward in the bed, the
carbon deposits were removed by hydrogenation and gasiﬁcation
reactions with steam. Miyazawa et al. [205] reported a lower carbon
yield on various nickel catalysts during partial oxidation than during
steam reforming. This phenomenon can be explained by carbon
combustion with O 2during the catalyst ﬂuidization. Another process
dealing with both the conversion of hydrocarbons and formation of
carbon on active surfaces is ﬂuid catalytic cracking [206] (FCC). In FCC

3. Non-catalytic tar removal
The water scrubber is the existing technique commonly used
in many gasiﬁcation plants to remove contaminants and tar
[211 –213]. The scrubbing process, also referred to as gas absorp-
tion process, is a unit operation in which one or more contami-
nants of gas stream are selectively absorbed into an absorbent.Theoretically, the contaminant in the gas phase must have some
solubility in the scrubbing liquid [214] . Owing to the fact that tar
is a mixture of several hundreds of organics having low or no
water-solubility characteristics (hydrophobic substances), water
is not appropriate to be used as a scrubbing medium for tar
removal. Therefore, use of other kinds of absorbents, especially
hydrophobic absorbents, should be more effective for tar
absorption.
In our laboratory, Phuphuakrat [215] investigated several kinds
of scrubbing liquids (water, diesel fuel, biodiesel fuel, veg",320,"[-0.00411491  0.04070858 -0.00520669 ... -0.00866398  0.02073737

against real biomass tar without a ugmentation of mass transfer
operation such as spray towers and packed columns. Fig. 21 presents
the concentration of gravimetric tar collected at the exit of the
scrubber comparing to that with no absorbent. It shows that the
producer gas contained tar of 13.3 g/m
3. The concentration of the
gravimetric tar decreased when scrubbed by water, vegetable oil,
and engine oil, whereas it increased when scrubbed by diesel and
biodiesel fuel. While using water as an absorption medium, it
showed the efﬁciency of 31.8% for gravimetric tar removal. Water
could reduce the gravimetric tar down to 9.1 g/m3.A l t h o u g hm o s to f
tar components have less or no solubility in water, the decrease in
the gravimetric tar by water scrubber can be attributed to con-
densation. The temperature of the water scrubber (28–28.5 1C) was
lower than the temperature of the entering gas stream (30.8–
33.6 1C). In the water scrubber, tar condensed as a separate liquid
on the water surface. Because of solubility of tar, the change of

back of losing the absorption medium due to easy evaporation.
Although the diesel fuel vapor can be combusted in engines and
does not cause fouling, it needs to reﬁll the absorption medium inorder to maintain the gas residence time in the scrubber. More-
over, diesel fuel is not economical. Therefore, vegetable oil can be
selected to absorb biomass tar. Even though vegetable oil also

carbon tars (especially benzene, toluene, and xylene) reducing the

Then, Paethanom [217] continued to investigate heavy tar
removal by absorption using vegetable oil and waste-cooking oil
scrubbers and light tar removal by adsorption using rice husk and
rice husk char adsorbent bed shown in Fig. 22 (A). It can be seen
that after high temperature gasiﬁed, rice husk char became a
highly porous material. Therefore, this char was found to have
suitable characteristics to be used as a tar removal adsorbent
(Fig. 22 (B)). It was indicated that, in all conditions, vegetable oil
showed better tar removal performance and the optimum mixing
speed was 1000 rpm for the vegetable oil scrubber and 750 rpm
for the waste cooking oil ( Fig. 23 (A)). This can be explained that,
contaminants in waste cooking oil, such as nitrogen and sulfur
[217] , weaken the Van der Waal’s force between oil molecules
and absorbed tar. Therefore, with a too high mixing speed, not

demonstrated for the co-production of pure hydrogen and syngas from biomass wastes using high-flux solar 
irradiation. In this system, a steam reactor and a solar fuel reactor were adopted to replace the air and fuel 
reactors in a typical biomass chemical looping gasification (BCLG) system, respectively. The SBCLG exhibits two 
advantages over BCLG: (1) the syngas yield is raised as the high-temperature process heat is provided by solar 
radiation rather than biomass combustion, and (2) a pure hydrogen stream is generated in addition to the syngas 
stream, which allows a flexible adjustment of the carbon-to-hydrogen ratio for downstream chemical processes. 
This study marked the first demonstration of a complete cycle of SBCLG in a cavity-type packed-bed solar reactor 
under simulated high-flux solar irradiation. Magnetite (Fe3O4) was circulated between the steam reactor and the 
solar fuel reactor as the oxygen carrier (OC). The optimal operational parameters, the reaction temperature and 
solid contact pattern, were first determined in preliminary experiments in an electric furnace. Then, the effect",258,"[ 0.00018078  0.01261124  0.00498225 ... -0.00566575 -0.01144202

solar reactor. When mRH:mOC 1:2, the highest values of the average carbon-gas yield of 0.69 ±0.05 and energy 
upgrade factor of 0.71 ±0.04 were achieved. The solar fuel reactor produced CH4, CO, CO2 and H2 at 0.63, 
11.86, 8.85, and 18.53 mmol/g biomass, respectively, with the steam reactor yielding high-purity H2 at 7.17 
mmol/g biomass. The results indicated that the SBCLG is a viable method for co-production of pure hydrogen and 
syngas in separate streams.   
1.Introduction 
As apprehensions regarding the contribution of fossil fuels to global 
warming intensify, biomass has garnered augmented consideration due 
to its widespread availability, renewability, and CO2 neutrality [1,2] . 
Gasification is an attractive thermochemical approach for converting 
low-energy –density biomass into high-quality syngas (mainly H2 CO) 
at high temperatures [3,4] . The produced gaseous fuel can subsequently 
be processed into a range of products such as electricity [5], hydrogen [6], liquid fuels [7], and chemicals [8]. However, due to the inherent 
endothermic feature of the gasification",310,"[ 0.03685175  0.0237806   0.0319413  ...  0.01392463 -0.00726629

needs to be burnt with air in conventional autothermal gasification, 
resulting in a limited cold gas efficiency and low calorific value of 
syngas. 
Chemical looping gasification (CLG) [9,10] is a promising technol -
ogy to solve this problem, in which metal-oxide-based oxygen carrier 
(OC) is adopted for oxygen transport, avoiding direct contact between 
fuels and air. In a typical biomass chemical looping gasification (BCLG) 
process, oxygen carriers circulate between two main reactors, a fuel

is first reduced to provide oxygen for biomass conversion, producing 
syngas at the same time. The inorganic species found in biomass ash are 
good gasification catalysts, which can enhance the reactivity [11]. Then, 
the reduced metal oxide is circulated to the AR to be regenerated before 
a new cycle, releasing a large amount of heat. The OC transfers lattice

Based on that, a three-reactor BCLG concept was proposed to improve

3fuel reactor. In the FR, MexOy is reduced to MexOy-2 while biomass is 
converted to syngas, which is the same as traditional BCLG. In the SR, 
MexOy-2 is oxidized by H2O to MexOy-1, and high-purity H2 is generated 
at the same time. In the air reactor, the OC is regenerated to its original 
state by air to close the loop. Fe-based materials were adopted in most 
BCCLP studies, and the cycle could be Fe/FeO –Fe3O4–Fe/FeO or Fe/ 
FeO–Fe3O4–Fe2O3–Fe/FeO depending on whether the AR is applied 
[14]. Zeng et al. [15] experimentally studied such process using sawdust 
as feedstock in a dual fluidized bed gasifier. Under optimal conditions, 
the cold gas efficiency in the FR was 77.21 % and the H2 yield in the SR 
was 0.279 Nm3 kg 1. Lin et al. [16] adopted NiFe 2O4 as the OC and 
conducted a 15-loop test in a fixed bed to prove its reliability. In some 
studies, all the carbon in the biomass feedstock was designed to leave the 
FR in the form of CO2, making the process a hybrid of chemical-looping 
combustion and the steam-iron process [17–19]. Cormos [17] presented 
the techno-economic evaluation of hydrogen and power co-generation 
based on BCCLP concept, where the carbon capture energy penalty 
was significantly lower than that in reference systems. Ryd˘en et al. [19] 
continuously operated Fe/FeO –Fe3O4–Fe/FeO cycle in two inter-
connected fluidized beds, producing H2 in the steam reactor. The whole 
reactor was placed inside an electrically heat furnace to maintain a 
suitable temperature. Though BCCLP is promising, thermal self- 
sufficiency might be a problem when considering large latent heat of 
water required in the SR and the potential increase in heat loss owing to 
component additions. One approach is to extract a portion of Fe/FeO 
from the FR and directly send it to the AR, at the",510,"[ 3.9409338e-03  1.8351439e-02 -6.5532484e-05 ...  2.9064780e-03

AR, external heat must be supplied to reach thermal balance. 
The integration of solar energy into biomass gasification has 
garnered significant interest within the scientific community [20–24]. 
Point-focusing solar concentrators (e.g., parabolic dish and solar tower) 
have the capability to concentrate solar irradiation in excess of 1000 
suns (1 sun 1 kW⋅m 2). This level of concentration proves optimal for 
driving solar thermochemical processes at elevated temperatures 
[25–27]. In the realm of solar-driven biomass gasification, extensive 
experimental investigations have been conducted employing cavity-type 
solar receiver-reactors. Among the various configurations studied are 
the packed-bed [28–30], fluidized-bed [31–33], spouted-bed [34–36], 
entrained-flow [37], and vortex-flow [38,39] solar gasifiers. Several 
factors render the solar-driven approach superior to the conventional 
autothermal process [38,40] :  
1. Higher syngas yield: In solar-driven biomass gasification process, 
the heat required for the reaction is provided by concentrated solar 
irradiation rather than the combustion of the biomass feedstock, 
resulting a higher yield syngas per unit mass of feedstock. 
2.Improved syngas quality: The incorporation of solar energy facil-
itates the attainment of elevated reaction temperatures, resulting in 
an increased proportion of carbon monoxide (CO) in the syngas 
produced, while concurrently reducing the formation of undesirable 
by-products. 
3.Enhanced reaction kinetics: Solar-driven biomass gasification al-
lows for higher gasification temperatures (F1200 •C), which results 
in faster reaction kinetics.

duced herein. Fig. 1c illustrates the proposed SBCLG process. The FR is 
replaced by a cavity-type solar fuel reactor (SFR), where biomass is 
pyrolyzed and further gasified by OC (Fe3O4). The main reactions in SFR

Solar energy serving as the high-temperature heat source, eliminates the 
necessity of the employment of the AR. The redox cycle is simplified to a 
two-step cycle of iron between its oxidized and reduced forms: Fe/ 
FeO–Fe3O4–Fe/FeO. Magnetite (Fe3O4) is a naturally occurring ferrite 
with vast reserves and a low cost. Furthermore, magnetite ’s peculiar 
magnetic properties render it particularly suitable for OC recovery from 
the ash. The SBCLG exhibits two advantages over its conventional 
counterparts: (1) The gas yield is raised as the high-temperature process 
heat is provided by high-flux solar radiation rather than biomass com-
bustion. (2) Syngas and hydrogen are produced in separated streams and 
can be blended at any proportion to achieve a desirable carbon-to- 
hydrogen ratio for carbon –neutral liquid fuel production, such as 
methanol synthesis [41] and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis [42]. 
In addition, this process bears similarities to a two-step solar water 
splitting cycle, with the only distinction lying in the SF",587,"[-0.00499105 -0.00471744  0.01700565 ...  0.01432371 -0.00511432

splitting, the OC is reduced under high temperatures in an inert atmo -
sphere, releasing O2 at the same time. Conversely, in the proposed 
process, the OC is reduced within a reducing atmosphere where both 
char and reducing gas are present. This alteration enables a decrease in 
reaction temperature, subsequently reducing reradiation losses. More -
over, the liberated O is effectively utilized for gasifying the biomass 
feedstock. 
Interest in SBCLG research has been consistently on the rise since its 
inception. Chuayboon et al. [43] experimentally investigated solar- 
driven CLG utilizing ZnO in a spouted-bed solar reactor. The study 
successfully demonstrated the potential for simultaneous production of 
Zn and syngas. However, a challenge arose as Zn was in a gaseous state 
at the reaction temperature and condensed during the subsequent gas 
cooling stage, making it difficult to close the chemical looping process. 
Sun et al. [44] thermodynamically studied solar-assisted BCLG with 
Fe3O4 in an indirect coupling, where an OC storage tank was used to 
absorb solar energy. In a case study, syngas from the FR was mixed with 
pure H2 from the SR to ensure an appropriate carbon-to-hydrogen ratio 
for methanol synthesis. Compared with an auto-thermal CLG process, 
the solar-assisted configuration produced more methanol while emitted 
less carbon. This meaningful work needs further experimental 
verification. 
In this work, we present the inaugural experimental demonstration 
of a complete cycle of SBCLG for the co-production of syngas and 
hydrogen in separated streams using simulated high-flux solar irradia -

demonstrate the feasibility of syngas and hydrogen co-production. The 
influence of reactant mass ratio and other parameters on system per-
formances was also studied. 
2.Experiment and method 
2.1. Materials 
In the global scenario, rice production reached 787.3 million tonnes 
in 2021, with Asia accounting for 89.9 % of the total output [45]. Rice 
husks (RHs) constitute approximately 20 % of the weight of rice pro-
duced. While rice husks possess usefulness, improper handling can 
transform them into hazardous waste. Hence, the development of waste- 
to-energy technologies assumes paramount significance in effectively 
managing this waste stream. In this work, rice husks sourced from 
Indonesia were collected and employed as the primary raw feedstock. 
The rice husks were washed and ground with screen mesh size of less 
than 1 mm. After drying at 105 •C for 24 h in a drying oven, the obtained 
moisture-free rice husk powders were employed as the feedstock in this 
study. Table 1 shows the detailed properties of the feedstock. Rice husk, 
as indicated from proximate and ultimate analysis, is a common biomass 
with a high volatile and oxygen content. The heating values of RHs were 
estimated using the correlations presented in ref. [46] dependent on the 
ultimate and proximate analysis. Ash samples were acquired by com-
busting of rice husks at 550 •C in an air environment for a duration of 4 h 
using a muffle furnace. The composition analysis of the resulting ash was 
performed by an Optima 5300 DV inductively coupled plasma emission 
spectrometer made by PerkinElmer, U.S.A. Sample was digested with 
HNO 3/HCl/HF (3:1:1) on hotplate for 2 h and top up to 10 mL with H2O.",446,"[-6.0255472e-05  7.9248619e-04  2.7531095e-02 ... -3.6566686e-03

wt%), Mg (0.21 wt%), Fe (1.50 wt%), Al (0.05 wt%) and Mn (0.08 wt%). 
The OC particles used in this study were iron (II, III) oxide (Fe3O4 
powder, D5 μm, 95 %) provided by Sigma-Aldrich. 
2.2. Experimental 
2.2.1. Preliminary studies in an electric furnace 
A series of pre-experiments were first conducted in an electric 
furnace to determine suitable operation parameters for solar runs (see details in Section 3.1). The experimental bench and its components were 
described in Fig. 2. The reactor assembled in the vertical electric furnace 
was a quartz tube with a 25 mm inner diameter and a 400 mm height. 
Within the tube, a specific section was designed with a reduced caliber 
area to accommodate the reactants. The reactants were placed inside a 
quartz basket equipped with perforations at the bottom. Quartz wool 
was employed as a support medium for the solid particles, while 
allowing for the passage of gaseous flow. To investigate the influence of 
direct contact between biomass particles and OC on the experimental 
outcomes, two distinct reactant contact patterns were employed: (a) 
Biomass particles and OC were placed in separate quartz baskets without 
direct solid-to-solid contact. OC was placed on the downstream side to 
react with reducing gas generated through the pyro-gasification of 
biomass. (b) Single quartz basket was used in which rice husk particles 
were thoroughly mixed with Fe3O4 by mechanical stirring. The tem-
perature of the reactor was measured by a K-type thermocouple placed 
near the samples and was controlled by a programmable temperature 
controller. Water fe",441,"[ 0.01206142 -0.00753116  0.00093176 ...  0.00706849  0.00609497

liquid water would automatically become steam once entering the high- 
temperature reaction zone. The produced gas flew through a cooling and 
filtering unit before entering the mass spectrometer (MS, Hiden quan-
titative analysis system). 
In a CLG test (both Contact Pattern A & B), the quartz reactor was 
initially mounted in the electric furnace at room temperature. A purging 
gas, Argon (99.99 %), was introduced into the reactor at a controlled 
flow rate of 100 mL/min at standard temperature and pressure (STP). 
After purging the reactor to reach a steady state where the gas compo -
sitions kept within a minor variation (±0.01 %) for 5 min, the reaction 
zone was uniformly heated to the objective temperature (700 •C/ 
800 •C/900 •C). The duration of the heating stage was set to be 40 mins 
to best align with that of the solar experiments (see Section 3.2). After 
reaching the target temperature, the reactor was kept at a constant 
temperature for 30 min to allow for biomass gasification. These pro-
cedures closely simulated the reactions occurring within the fuel reactor 
(FR). 
When biomass and OC were separately placed (Contact Pattern A), 
the reactor was cooled to room temperature in an Argon atmosphere. 
The biomass residues and reduced OC were then carefully removed from 
the reactor and weighed for subsequent analysis. In the following stage, 
which simulates the steam reactor (SR), only the reduced OC were 
placed into the reactor for the steam-iron reaction. This was done to 
exclude any potential influence of the steam-char reaction. Once the 
reactor had been purged to achieve a steady state, the reaction zone was 
uniformly heated to 600 •C over a period of 20 min and held at that 
temperature for 40 min. Simultaneously, st",411,"[ 0.01418054  0.03995312  0.02311372 ... -0.01616413  0.01589684

reactor at a rate of 10 g/h. For experiments adopting Contact Pattern B, 
the solids were not removed from the reactor between the two-stage 
reactions. Instead, the reactor was cooled while purging until it 
reached 600 •C, at which point the second-stage iron-water reaction 
began. Like Contact Pattern A, the steam injection rate was maintained 
at 10 g/h for a duration of 40 min. Steam was supplied in excess to 
maximize the H2 production. The unreacted steam can be conveniently 
recovered by condensation and, thus, high-purity H2 was collected. 
2.2.2. Solar experimental setup 
The solar-driven biomass chemical looping gasification experimental 
system was composed of a solar simulator, a cavity-type packed-bed 
solar reactor, a gas/steam feeding system, a gas scrubber, and a gas 
analysis system. The experimental setup and the details of process flows 
were schematically illustrated in Fig. 3. The photography of the exper -
imental apparatus was shown in Fig. 4. Experiments of the solar-driven 
chemical looping gasification of biomass were conducted under Singa -
pore ’s first 28-kWe high flux solar simulator (HFSS) which consists of 7 
radiative modules and approximates radiative characteristics of on-sun 
concentrating systems. Each radiative module has its own power 
source that can be adjusted in the range of 0.9–3.8 kWe. The radiative Table 1

two primary indicators: carbon-gas yield and energy upgrade factor. The

cludes both syngas production in the FR and high-purity hydrogen 
production in the SR. 3.Result and discussion 
3.1. Determination of operation parameters 
The optimal operation temperature of solar fuel reactor TFR and 
reactant interaction pattern were first determined through a series of 
preliminary experiments in an electric furnace. Table 2 showed the gas 
generated from biomass pyro-gasification and steam-iron reaction under 
different operation parameters. The carbon-gas yield Yc and the energy 
upgrade factor U were also reported. 
In Case 01–09, rice husks and Fe3O4 were placed separately during 
the pyro-gasification stage (Contact pattern A). The mass of OC was 
fixed at 1.00 g, while the mass of RHs varied from 0.50 to 1.50 g. The 
findings revealed that a higher OC to RHs mass ratio resulted in 
increased carbon gas yield and cold gas efficiency (as observed in Case 
01–03, Case 04–06, and Case 07–09). This outcome can be attributed to 
the fact that the addition of OC as an oxidation agent pro",269,"[-0.0006401   0.00065811  0.02527406 ...  0.01074116  0.01817734

conversion. Furthermore, considering the operation time was kept 
constant, it was observed that using a larger amount of biomass feed-
stock led to more challenging conversion processes. 
The influence of the fuel reactor ’s operation temperature TFR on the 
overall process performance was also studied. As the temperature was 
increased from 700 •C to 800 •C, taking Case 01 and Case 04 as exam -
ples, the carbon-gas yield YC rose from 20.52 % to 25.73 %. This is 
because, from a thermodynamic point of view, higher temperatures 
have a facilitating effect on the biomass gasification reaction, favouring 
the production of gases and generating less char and tar. Concurrently, 
the partial pressures of reductive gases such as CO and H2 increased 
within the system, resulting in a higher degree of OC reduction in the FR. 
Consequently, during the second step of reaction with steam in the SR, a 
greater quantity of hydrogen was released (elevating from 3.80 mmol/g

correspondingly heightened by 7.27 %. However, when the temperature 
was increased from 800 •C to 900 •C, cold gas efficiency of the process U

reduction in hydrogen yield during the subsequent water-iron reaction. 
Specifically, the hydrogen gas yield decreased from 6.72 mmol/g to 
1.63 mmol/g (as observed in Case 04 and Case 07). In general, the 
temperature increase represented a trade-off: on one hand, it can

reducing the yield of bio-oil. Additionally, the hydrogen gas yield in the

ides, leading to lower metal oxide reduction degrees. Similarly, a sharp

were also generated from t ~20 min but their peak values were 
considerably less pronounced. The peaks of H2 and CH4 were 0.11 
mmol/min at t 37 min and 0.03 mmol/min at t 31 min, respectively. 
In light of the lignin content present within rice husk, the devolatiliza -
tion process persisted over a considerably extended duration. There was 
a continual generation of gaseous components prior to the attainment of 
the targeted temperature during the heating stage (t D40 min). The 
beginning of char gasification marked as CO molar flow rate increased at 
t ~33 min, followed by an increase in CO2 flow rate after a 4-min 
delay. The peaks of CO and CO2 in the gasification stage were 0.05 
mmol/min and 0.13 mmol/min at t 44 min (4 min after reaching the 
target operation temperature). The reaction mechanism of the gasifi -
cation process is summarized as follows: As seen in reactions (R4) –(R7), 
upon the reactor temperature reaching 700 •C, magnetite reacted with 
the reductive gases present within the reactor (primarily H2 and CO), 
undergoing reduction to a lower oxidation state (Fe/FeO), concurrently 
engendering H2O and CO2. Steam and carbon dioxide, serving as gasi-
fication agents, gasified the fixed carbon in the solid residue, yielding 
CO and H2, as shown in reactions (R2) and (R3). This, in turn, facilitated 
the reduction reaction of the metal oxides. The final gaseous product 
composition was determined collectively by reactions (R2) –(R7) and 
other side reactions such as the (reverse) water –gas shift reaction (R10) .

the mixing of RHs and OC had a notable effect on enhancing the gasi-
fication of char, resulting in more gas yield in this period. On one hand, 
the water and carbon dioxide generated in Reactions (R4) –(R7) were 
capable of in-situ interaction with the fixed carbon, thereby mitigating 
the likelihood of their removal by the sweep gas. On the other hand, due 
to the direct contact of solids, the metal oxides also engaged in direct 
reduction [51] by the biochar at elevated temperatures via reactions 
(R11) and (R12) : 
CFe3O4→3FeOCO (R11)  
CFeO→FeCO (R12) 
The peaks of CO and CO2 in the gasification stage were 0.09 mmol/ 
min and 0.17 mmol/min, respectively, which were comparable in 
quantity to those in the pyrolysis stage. Owing to the effective contact 
between solid particles, the biomass feedstock underwent more thor-
ough gasification, resulting in a 3 % increase in carbon-gas yield. 
Simultaneously, Fe3O4 underwent more complete reduction, leading to 
a higher hydrogen gas yield during the iron-water reaction (Fig. 5d). 
Consequently, the overall cold gas efficiency was elevated from 26.66 % 
to 41.78 %. In addition, the presence of silica in rice husk ash could 
function as a support for OCs, effectively suppressing the sintering of 
OCs [52]. 
Taking into account the results from the aforementioned pre- 
experimental trials, the determined operational parameters for solar experiment were presented in Table 3. In each test, a mixture of 10 g 
biomass and OC was used as the feedstock, following mechanical 
agitation. In Cases A, B, and C, the mass ratio of rice husks to Fe3O4 was 
1:1, 1:2, and 2:1, respectively. The reaction temperature for the first 
stage pyro-gasification was set at 750 •C, which closely approximated 
the optimal",492,"[ 0.02145178  0.0045292   0.00822465 ...  0.00381142  0.02098789

decision to avoid employing a higher temperature was aimed at pre-
venting the sintering of the oxygen carriers. It should be noted that the 
temperature measured by the thermocouple corresponded to the bottom 
of the solid bed. In a directly irradiated packed bed solar reactor, the 
upper layers of the solid bed were subjected to direct illumination, 
resulting in higher surface temperatures. During the second stage of the 
steam-iron reaction, the reaction temperature was maintained at 600 •C 
for a duration of 30 min, with steam injection occurring at a rate of 1.0 
g/min. All cases were repeated for at least twice and the average data 
was reported. 
3.2. Representative solar experimental runs 
In a typical solar experimental run, the rice husk and Fe3O4 particles 
were mechanically mixed and fed into the solar reactor. Cooling water 
was circulated to the water-cooled shield and the gas agent of Argon was 
introduced to the reactor at a rate of 2.0 LN/min before turning on the 
xenon lamps. After purging the system to reach a steady state where the 
gas compositions remained under a 0.01 % variation for 3 min, 7 lamps 
with 1 kWe per lamp were turned on at t 0, followed by 2 kWe per lamp 
at t 5 min. After that, the electric power was increased to 3 kWe per 
lamp at t 10 min, until the reactor temperature reached 700 •C. When 
the temperature reading was close to the target temperature for gasifi -
cation, the lamp power was reduced to maintain the bed temperature at 
around 750 •C for 30 min. Subsequently, we turned off all lamps and 
wait for the reactor to cool down to the temperature for steam-iron re-
action. During the steam-iron reaction stage, two lamps, each with a

Figs. 6–8 illustrate the representative operations based on the pro-

power input delivered to the aperture and the temperature of reaction 
bed in Case-A, while Fig. 6b illustrates the molar flow rates of the major 
gas species in the cold product gas. As shown in Fig. 6a, the heating rates 
of the reaction bed increased as the solar power input increased, and 
approximate linear increase in reactant temperature was witnessed after 
t 10 min. The whole heating period lasted for 40 min (from t 0), due 
to a large heat capacity of the reactor insulation. Though solar power 
was turned down when T 700 •C, the bed temperature was still slightly 
increasing in a few minutes. The observed overshoot occurred due to the 
time required for heat transfer from the directly irradiated, hotter sur-
faces to reach the thermocouple. As shown in Fig. 6b, the initial stage of 
rice husk pyrolysis occurred at t 5 min, marked by devolatilization and 
a rapid increase in CO, CO2, H2, and CH4 molar flow rates. It was worth 
noting that the temperature of the reactants at the bottom was still low 
(D100 •C), which indicated that the pyrolysis started at the bed surface.

11outcome suggests that it is feasible to control the composition and yield 
of the product gas in the fuel reactor and steam reactor by manipulating 
the mass ratio between biomass and the oxygen carrier. CH4 yield was 
relatively low in this process with other gas species, as it was primarily 
generated during the biomass pyrolysis stage. Consequently, it was less 
influenced by the reactant mass ratio. The influence of biomass to OC 
mass ratio on the synthesis gas generation in the FR is rather complex. 
On one hand, an increased amount of OC is advantageous for improving 
carbon conversion rates, which contributes to the generation of CO and 
H2. On the other hand, an excessive amount of OC requires the con-
sumption of more reductive gases (CO, H2, and CH4) to reduce it to a 
lower valence state. Therefore, the yields of CO and H2 in the FR did not 
exhibit a monotonic trend with variations in the reactant mass ratio. 
From an energy perspective, in Case-B where the mass ratio of biomass 
to oxygen carrier was 1:2, the energy upgrade factor was the highest, 
reaching 0.71 ±0.04. As the mass of biomass increased, the cold gas 
efficiency in Case-A and Case-C decreased to 0.64 ±0.05 and 0.55 ±
0.01. 
A comparison of the experimental results of our SBCLG process with

hydrogen yield and the temperature of the fuel reactor was maintained 
by electrical heating. Whether the heat generated during the regenera -
tion of the OC can meet the system ’s thermal self-sufficiency warrants 
further experimental exploration. In our process, by incorporating 
concentrated solar energy, we have ensured the thermal stability of the 
system. Moreover, this integration has enabled the production of syngas 
and high-purity hydrogen in distinct flow streams. Through comparison 
with other works, it can be observed that the cold gas efficiency of our 
system U is at a relatively high level. The total gas yield was roughly 
equivalent to other studies, but the overall hydrogen production is 
higher, reaching 25.2 mmol/g biomass. This was attributed to a signif -
icant portion of hydrogen being generated in the SR through the steam- 
iron reaction. Chuayboon et al. [43] also employed solar energy in a 
similar process, using beech wood as feedstock and Zn/ZnO as the redox 
pair, achieving biomass gasification and carbothermal reduction of ZnO 
at the same time. In their process, the energy upgrade factor reached 
1.17. This was a result of the reaction zone reaching high temperatures 
of 1250 •C through solar energy, a condition that effectively facilitated 
the conversion of fixed carbon into gaseous products. However, at the 
operation temperature, Zn became gaseous, posing challenges for re-
covery and",321,"[ 0.03034974  0.02068373  0.01975283 ... -0.0002395   0.02554224

circulating particles in the SBCLG process. Upon comparison, it is 
evident that the carbon conversion rate YC in our system is relatively 
lower, due to two primary reasons: (1) In other studies, steam was 
introduced into the FR to enhance carbon conversion, an approach we 
did not adopt to prevent the OC from being oxidized to Fe3O4 in the FR, 
which would decrease the hydrogen yield in the SR. (2) We utilized a 
batch processing method with a heating duration of approximately 40 
min, leading to a slow heating rate of the reactants. Consequently, part 
of the biomass feedstock was converted into bio-oil instead of syngas. 
Further endeavours could focus on modifying the reactor design and 
altering the feedstock delivery method (to achieve continuous feeding) 
to enhance the carbon conversion rate, thereby further increasing the 
gas yield and cold gas efficiency.

After each experiment, the solar reactor was cooled down with 
continuous argon flow and the solid remains were collected when the 
reaction chamber reached room temperature. The mineral crystal

12Fig. 10 shows XRD patterns for refresh OC (Fe3O4) and the solids 
collected for different cases. After undergoing a loop, the OC predomi -
nantly remained in the form of magnetite (Fe3O4) in all cases. However, 
the intensity of their peaks was noticeably lower than that of the fresh 
OC, due to the carbon coverage. This phenomenon was more pro-
nounced in the cases with higher quantities of biomass. In Case-B, a 
minority of FeO was detected, while in Case-A and Case-C, a small 
amount of Fe2O3 was found. The difference was attributed to the 
different OC loads in the system. For a certain rate and time of steam 
injection, OC with less mass was more likely to be oxidized to a higher 
valence state. Meanwhile, silica (SiO 2), as the primary component of rice 
husk ash, was clearly observed in the solid residues. 
Apart from silica and iron oxides, Fe and Si elements were also 
present in the form of fayalite (α-Fe2SiO4, PDF number: 01–071-1667) in 
each of the cases. Fe2SiO4 is an iron-rich end member of olivine

conditions. Conversely, γ-Fe2SiO4 has a cubic spinel-type structure but 
forms only at high temperatures and pressures [55]. Fayalite is pre-
dominantly composed of iron in the ferrous form (Fe2). At elevated 
temperatures it can either undergo transformation into a mixture of 
magnetite and/or hematite mixtures with silica in oxidizing atmo -
spheres or reduction to metallic iron under strongly reducing conditions 
[56]. It can be inferred that fayalite was formed in pyro-gasification 
stage during the experiment where the elevated temperature and 
lower valence states of iron facilitates the reaction. Though a by-product 
in our process, fayalite is regarded as an efficient tar removal catalyst for 
biomass gasification, which can significantly improve CO yield, cold gas 
efficiency and carbon conversion efficiency [57,58] . Hence, in the pro-
posed solar-driven biomass chemical looping gasification process, 
α-Fe2SiO4 could be kept in the looping, serving as a catalyst.

SBCLG concept, employing magnetite (Fe3O4) particles as the oxygen 
carrier (OC), and systematically explored its performance under varying 
parameters. The main conclusions are summarized as follows:  
(1) A proof-of-concept experiment was conducted in a cavity-type 
packed-bed solar reactor under concentrated solar radiation 
emitted by a 28 kWe high-flux solar simulator. Rice husks and 
Fe3O4 were used as the biomass feedstock and the OC, respec -
tively. The results indicated that the SBCLG is a viable method for 
producing syngas and high-purity hydrogen in separate streams, 
which can be subsequently mixed to achieve a specified carbon- 
to-hydrogen ratio for downstream chemical processing.  
(2) The results of preliminary studies unveiled a paradoxical impact 
of the fuel reactor (FR) temperature on the system ’s overall 
performance: on one hand, increased FR temperature enhances 
the syngas yield during the pyro-gasification stage, while on the 
other hand, it exacerbated the sintering of the OC. An optimal 
operation temperature of 800 •C was identified for the FR. 
Notably, direct solid",276,"[ 0.0111602  -0.00167855  0.0292608  ...  0.00270604  0.00055454

Fe3O4 was found to alleviate OC sintering, enhance carbon con-
version, and improve cold gas efficiency.  
(3) Under the optimal reaction temperature and reactant contact 
pattern, the SBCLG of rice husks using Fe3O4 as the OC was sys-
tematically investigated across various mass ratios. It indicated 
that at mRH:mOC 1:2, highest values of the average carbon-gas 
yield of 0.69 ±0.05 and energy upgrade factor of 0.71 ±0.04 
were achieved. The corresponding gas yield in the solar fuel 
reactor were as follows: 0.63 mmol/g biomass for CH4, 11.86 
mmol/g biomass for CO, 8.85 mmol/g biomass for CO2, 18.53 
mmol/g biomass for H2. High-purity H2 was produced in the 
steam reactor at 7.17 mmol/g biomass. It’s noteworthy that when 
keeping the mass of RHs and OC constant, reducing the mass ratio 
of OC to RHs leads to a lower carbon conversion rate, which in 
turn reduces the energy upgrade factor.  
(4) Due to the interaction between silica in the RH ash and OC at 
elevated temperatures, the presence of α-Fe2SiO4 was found in 
the recycled solids as a by-product according to XRD analysis.

1.Introduction
Presently, the industrial production of H2 and petroleum compounds 
relies heavily on the conversion of natural gas or lighter hydrocarbons 
via steam-methane reforming (SMR), auto-thermal reforming (ATR), 
partial oxidation (PO), and X-to-Fuel technologies that use synthetic gas 
or oils from gasification or pyrolysis [1,2]. Notwithstanding their p",170,"[ 0.02107536 -0.03791142  0.02148717 ...  0.00361551 -0.00719469

cross-generational dependency tied to operational efficiencies, these 
routes habor intensive CO2 emissions and thermodynamic inefficiencies 
owing to the eventual unsustainable nature of the fuel feedstock used e. 
g., Coal., and the multiple additional units employed for the cleaning 
and purification of the resultant output [3,4]. Hence, alternative tech-
nologies with improved thermodynamic efficiencies coupled with car-
bon capture and sequestration (CCS) are actively pursued in latent 
efforts to decarbonize the global energy portfolio and assert carbon 
neutrality by 2040 [4–6]. One such strategy is the coupling of chemical 
looping (CL) to both conventional and emerging X-to-Fuel 
primary-conversion technologies wit",155,"[-0.00857317  0.00575267  0.04541618 ...  0.00489535 -0.03011416

tentials, the ability to enable rapid ionic movement, the provision of low 
resistance to gaseous fusion, and the facilitation of elevated fuel con-
version and product selectivity [5,7]. Among adaptations considered, 
sorption-enhanced chemical looping gasification (SECLG) envisages an 
effective solution to achieving H2 production at reduced CO2 emissions 
and improved thermodynamic efficiency from in-situ CCS and a char-
acteristically high-quality syngas i.e., with reduced tar and CO2 content, 
which eliminates the energy and economic burden normally incurred for 
the producer gas cleaning and purification [12].
SECLG strategy uses both OC and CaO-sorbent in the same system to 
achieve high-purity H2 syngas promoted by near-zero CO2 concentra -
tions from an inherent CCS [13]. This is shown in Fig. 1.
To date, work on SECLG including that by Refs. [12,14–17], has 
hinted at possible practical operational thresholds and the thermal 
self-sufficiency of the adaptation using biomass and coal feedstocks via 
energy and exergy efficiencies to produce H2 and electricity and further 
demonstrated the artificial neural network (ANN) based machine 
learning optimization strategies of SECLG models. Others including 
[17], evaluated the economic feasibility of the adaptation to produce H2 
and key-platform alcohols including bio-butanol and pentanol. Addi-
tional work has focused on studying the reduction mechanisms of the 
adaptation using",340,"[ 0.01929917 -0.00145586  0.0428926  ... -0.00192867 -0.03450383

solid particles e.g. NixCa1 xO. Other studies have demonstrated tunable 
producer gas to produce syngas, pure H2, ammonia (NH 3), ethylene, and 
propylene [18]. While these are substantial in understanding and 
enhancing the broader mechanisms and benefits of CLG systems, in-
tricacies inherent in model development, and carrier efficiencies, still 
require further investigation. In this work, we demonstrate an uncon -
strained Langrage Multiplier GEM model of SECLG to produce H2 and 
Fischer Tropsch (FT) petroleum with near-zero CO2 emissions from 
inherent CCS using biomass waste (bagasse) as feed. Within the study, 
the comparative performance of “high-performance ” NiO and Fe2O3--
based OCs as well as their thermodynamic transitions and interactions 
with fuel volatiles, the producer gas, and the enhanced gasification 
environment are evaluated. Additionally, a Fischer Tropsch model based 
on the syngas attained from the adaptation is developed and evaluated 
for transportation fuel production.
2.Materials and methods

A Thermodynamic H2 and transportation fuels (TF) production 
model was developed using the commercial Aspen Plus simulation 
software. Properties linked to bio-residue characterization were ob-
tained elsewhere [19], while, those of the looping material including the MexOy, MexOy-1, CaO, and CaCO 3 were achieved using the FactSage.8.2

computing tool. Afterward, the Aspen Plus process modeling software 
embedded an executable FORTRAN script with FT component distri -
butions and constraints.
2.2. Aspen Plus model
The Peng Robinson-Boston Mathias (PR-BM) Equation of State (EOS) 
was used as the global method to relate property parameters including 
the temperature, pressure, and molar volume. Compared to the standard 
Peng Robinson cubic EOS in Eq (1), PR-BM does not inherently suffer 
from limitations brought upon by varied systems due to stronger polar 
interactions, phase behavior of complex associating molecules, and 
high-acentric factor-based mixtures [20]. As such, global interactions of 
polar instantaneously volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds 
emitted from biomass devolatilization, and subsequent FT synthesis are 
predicted to an acceptable accuracy. A simplified mathematical model 
for a standardized PR EOS is shown in Eq (1)[21].

3.Results and discussion
3.1. Model validation
The present model covers gasification, CL, calcination, MexOy 
regeneration, RCC, H2, and FT synthesis. Such grounds for model vali-
dation considered a gasification phase in the FR fitted with experimental 
and simulated steam gasification work reported in the literature [30,
31]. Additionally, H2 and FT synthesis developed in this work adopt 
approaches based on simulation and experiments described in work by 
Refs. [28,32,33], respectively. It is noted that while the present study

3.2. Thermodynamic modeling of SECLG
3.2.1. A performance evaluation of LS during enhanced gasification
A parametric study assessed the performance of NiO and Fe2O3 OCs 
in SECLG to produce high-purity H2 These are referred to as scenarios 1 
and 2, respectively. The parameters used include the FR temperature, FR 
pressure, ER, and SR. These were evaluated at 600–1000 •C, 1–11 bar, 
0.2–1 amu CaO/b, 1–2 amu H2O/b, and 2.2–4.2 atomic mass unit (amu) 
OC/b, respectively. Results from a sensitivity study are shown in Fig. 5.
3.2.1.1. The effects of the FR temperature. The effects of the FR tem-
perature on the presented scenarios are shown in Fig. 5a. While scenario 
1 is observed to have an overall increase in H2 production with the FR 
temperature at 0.698 –0.703 for 600–1000 •C, respectively, scenario 2 
exhibits a converse relationship with the H2 yield significantly reduced 
at 0.68 –0.625 for 600–1000 •C. Moreover, the H2 recovery via scenario 
1 is consistently superior to that from scenario 2 during this period. 
Notwithstanding the readily perceived influence of the different OCs 
employed, the observed relationship for H2 yield with the FR tempera -
ture may be better explained by the thermodynamic characterizatio",359,"[-0.01130738 -0.00443662  0.02871633 ... -0.00734136 -0.01294961

the different OCs used (Fig. 2). It is observed in Fig. 2that the overall 
Helmholtz Free Energy (ΔA) and entropy (ΔS) in both scenarios increase 
with the FR temperature as related to the above-stated relationship. For 
the evaluated FR temperatures at 600–1000 •C, NiO consistently has the 
highest ΔA potential as compared to Fe2O3. In fact, in line with the FR 
initial and endpoint temperatures assessed, these are at ( 268954.1, 
 304351.7) J versus ( 685196.1,  975355) J, respectively. This would 
as such, explain the above-stated relationships i.e., increasing H2 yield 
and NiO H2 production superiority over Fe2O3 with the FR temperature., 
as the higher the ΔA, the more lattice O2 release is favored [34,35]. 
Consequently, abundant lattice O2 decoupling from H2O along with any 
compatible O2-vector for effective collisions or interactions is favored. 
Hence, a consistently superior H2 yield in scenario 1 is observed as 
compared to that in scenario 2. While the present analysis bases the ΔA 
with the FR temperature and volume as the natural variables to combine both the internal energy (ΔU) and ΔS contributions, other literature e.g., 
a study by Ref. [36], evaluated similar relations using the Gibbs free 
energy (ΔG). Nonetheless, NiO’s capacity as a known catalyst for 
high-temperature systems might have",344,"[ 0.01185684 -0.01653205  0.00705177 ...  0.01640218  0.01940211

above-reported observations [37,38].
Similar observations to the ones indicated in this work i.e., for 
increasing H2 with the FR temperature., are also reported elsewhere [12,
17]. Here, [12], investigated the thermodynamic performance of an 
autothermal SECLG to produce H2 and electric power. In this work, NiO 
and CaO were used as OC and CC, respectively in Aspen Plus FR models 
operated at 600–740 •C. It was observed that in this FR temperature 
range, the H2 in the syngas decreased with the FR temperature. Else-
where, [17], evaluated the economic feasibility for SECLG of lignocel -
lulosic biomass to produce butanol and pentanol. Fe2O3 and CaO were 
used as OC and CC, respectively. Among the parameters considered, the 
H2 yield was evaluated at 200–1000 •C. It was observed that during this 
period, H2 was decreasing with the FR temperature. Nevertheless, the 
overall reduction in H2 with the FR temperature in scenario 2 may also 
similarly be owed to the thermodynamic properties of Fe2O3 at high 
temperatures which might instigate a shift in the chemical reaction 
equilibrium (CRE). This observation is similar to the findings by Refs. 
[16,39].
Amongst these, [16], evaluated the thermodynamic performance of 
SECLG with coal as fuel to produce H2-rich syngas using an Aspen Plus

and CaO as OC and sorbent, respectively. It was found that overall the H2 
production in syngas was in fact, decreasing with the FR temperature at 
5-3.5 kmol/h for 500–1000 •C. [39], proceeded to experimentally 
evaluate the CLG of pine wood biomass using a synthetic Fe2O3-based 
OC in a 1.5kW th continuous unit. Al2O3 was used as support for the FR 
temperature, ER, and O2/b ratio of 820–940 •C, 0.05 –0.65, and 0.2–0.6, 
respectively. Among the syngas constituents, it was also found that H2 
was steadily decreasing with FR temperature. However, understanding 
the in-depth behavior linked to the performance of Fe2O3 OC in 
high-temperature gasification systems will require further experimental 
studies.
CO2 in the product gas is significantly limited to «10 % of the product 
gas in both scenarios. This may be due to efficient carbon capture

stand more about the reaction kinetics of enhanced gasification with

3.2.1.2. The effects of the FR pressure. The results obtained for the ef-
fects of the FR pressure on enhanced gasification are presented in 
Fig. 5b). An overall decrease in H2 and CO2 yield in both scenarios is

pressure of 1 bar, reaches break-even at 5 bars, then, constantly de-

broad gasification kinetics, this lack of consistency in H2 yield with the 
FR pressure may be a result of a shift in the CRE which would favor the 
production of other syngas constituents namely CO2, CO, H2O, and CxHy. 
R1- R8 to validate this assertion are shown. It is additionally, noted that 
similar observations related to a CRE shift indication., are reported in a 
related study by Ref. [12]. However, contradicting observations are also 
reported in a study by Ref. [12] while other studies with",159,"[-0.01289621  0.00375234 -0.00406504 ... -0.03478487 -0.00378197

increased at 3.5–5.5 kmol/h while CO2 decreased at 3–0.1 kmol/h for 
CaO/C range of 0.2–1.3 amu CaO/C. Another study by Ref. [46], eval-
uated the SECLG of rice straw in a U-shaped fixed bed gasifier. The 
gasifier was operated at 600–850 •C with Fe2O3 and CaO as the LM. It 
was observed that an increase in CaO/C increased H2 yield and CO2 
sequestration.
For the CR range of 0.2–1 amu, scenario 1 is observed to almost 
consistently have lower H2, and higher CO2 concentrations as compared 
to scenario 2. Despite the influence of the different OCs employed, this 
may be due to a reduced amount of NiO due to a tradeoff balance from 
CaO addition. As such, less amount of NiO is available to catalyze the 
production of H2 in scenario 1 as compared to 2. Moreover, this obser -
vation may hint at the ability of Fe2O3 to maintain a consistent OC and 
catalysis performance at low concentrations as compared to NiO. 
However, these assertions should be subject to dispute or validation 
from other studies.

further noted that during this period, H2 initially peaks at 0.701 then

the feedstock used during the SECLG of carbon residues might also play a significant role in the performance analysis of these systems from 
which the extent of various reduction mechanisms may differ.
However, CO2 is observed to decrease steadily with RR in both sce-
narios. The addition of MexOy is observed to have minimal impact on

from this study that while the effect of RR within the ranges reported in 
this work and the study by Ref. [16], is observed to have minimal impact 
on the H2 production, RR above 5 amu indicates a steeply increasing CO2 
recovery in the product gas. However, with cc being a factor in this

compared to the individual FT products during the ASF based FT syn-
thesis [70]. Despite the OCs in scenarios 1 and 2, outlining comparable 
potentials for petroleum synthesis, the latter is observed to be slightly 
more efficient than the former for FT synthesis in terms of FT yield and 
CO availability. In fact, the FT yield in scenario 2 is consistently greater 
than that in scenario 1 for 1–150 •C and 1–40 bar. This may be due to 
elevated amounts of carbonaceous matter e.g. CO2, CO, CH4., available 
for conversion into more H2 and CO in scenario 2 as compared to 1. 
Consequently, the overall FT yield in scenario 2 is observed to be higher 
than that in scenario 1. However, the eventual FT yields for petroleum 
recovery in both scenarios could be improved.
4.Conclusions
This study demonstrated the SECLG of waste bagasse to produce 
high-purity H2 syngas and transportation fuels using high-performance 
NiO and Fe2O3 OCs. The results indicate that both OCs outline the 
highest potential for high-purity H2 recovery of ≽68 % at the lowest FR 
temperature a",277,"[-0.00593585 -0.02445866  0.00726096 ...  0.00861481 -0.00558462

CO2 was found to be significantly limited to substantially less than 10 % 
of the producer gas in both scenarios. For the case of feed recirculation, 
it was observed that striking the right balance between reductive agents 
e.g., H2O, MexOy etc., and biomass quantities used is essential in 
delivering high-quality product gas. As such, optimal ER, RR, and CR of 
1 CaO/dry fuel, ≼1 H2O(v)/dry fuel, and 0.2 MexOy/dry fuel, respec -
tively are proposed for high-purity H2 syngas with near-zero CO2 
emissions. In terms of the producer gas quality, tar formation, gas 
composition, and energy content of the syngas were evaluated. The 
overall tar yield in the syngas was attained at low yields within 2 ×10 5 
g/kg dry bagasse in both cases. Here, butane and ethane had the highest 
abundance as compared to naphthalene, phenanthrene, catechol, pro-
pane, and guaiacol. Further notable synfuel characteristics include 
elevated CH4 and H2O yields as compared to CO2 and CO. These i.e., CH4 
and H2O., roughly make up D0.4 by molar fraction of the syngas in both 
cases. For",315,"[ 0.02214246  0.00065347  0.02102636 ... -0.00438103 -0.00606801

minimum energy is embodied in the producer syngas for each scenario. 
Ultimately, the producer gas in both scenarios is effectively, and readily 
combustible. However, the maximum FCC of 27 % for both scenarios 
could be improved. The transportation fuel yield potential in both cases 
is promising owing to a tunable H2/CO ratio obtained post a reverse 
water gas shift phase.
In terms of OC performance, NiO is observed to be more efficient 
than Fe2O3 in delivering high-purity H2 syngas with increased CO2 
sequestration efficiencies at the lowest SECLG temperature and pres-
sures of 600 •C and 1 bar. However, the latter OC gains superiority in 
delivering a producer gas blend with elevated combustibility potentials 
and higher FT petroleum over the former. While both OCs could be re-
generated at the minimum AR temperature and aeration rate of 700 •C 
and 100 kg air/22.4 mol MexOy, the regeneration of NiO was observed to 
be more rapid than that of Fe2O3. Consequently, sufficient NiO could be

Introduction
At present, the combustion and utilization of fossil energy, such as coal, oil and natural 
gas will produce a large amount of CO 2, SO 2, NO x and other polluting gases, which will 
have a negative impact on the living environment of human beings. Compared with fossil 
fuels, hydrogen energy has become one of the most concerned energy sources in the 21st 
century due to its high calorific value and clean combustion products (Luo et al. 2018 ) (Yu 
et al. 2018 ). Now there are a few different approaches for H2 production including the 
steam methane reforming (SMR) and coal gasification combined with a water gas",200,"[ 0.00460211 -0.00029528  0.01230336 ...  0.01741811 -0.01297911

hydrogen generation, it is a complex process that involves many complex catalytic steps 
and additional equipment for purification of the H2 (Luo, 2017). Coal gasification process 
for H2 generation also has many drawbacks, such as capital intensive, relatively low 
efficiency and carbon intensive (Yu et al. 2018 ) (Zeng et al. 2012 ). China is rich in coal, 
and the coal-dominated resource structure will last a long time. Therefore, it is of great

hydrogen from coal.
Hydrogen generation by chemical looping process (CLHG) has received great attention 
in recent years. It is derived from the chemical looping combustion technology (CLC) 
which has an inherent CO 2 separation advantage (Müller et al. 2011 ). In the CLC process, 
fuel is fed into fuel reactor and then oxidized by the hot metal oxides MxOy to CO 2 and H2 
O. CO 2 can be easily obtained for the subsequent sequestration due to the high concentra -
tion. Meanwhile, the MxOy is reduced to MxOy-1. Then, MxOy-1 is introduced into the air 
reactor and oxidized to its initial state (Cleeton et al.",181,"[ 0.00183221  0.00446678  0.01017552 ... -0.01965012 -0.03342243

E:\\PINNs-Research\\Searched Articles\\Study on Hydrogen Production of ZhunDong Coal.pdf,3,2,"2009 ). This process can obtain high 
purity CO 2 without expending any extra energy needed for separation. In the process of fuel 
combustion, the metal oxide replaces the air, avoiding the production of fuel NO x. The 
temperature of combustion reactor and air oxidation reactor for CLC are lower than that of 
conventional combustion, so thermal NO x generation is reduced (Niu and Xiao 2018 ). 
CLHG has the same general principles as CLC. The difference is that this process has an 
extra steam reactor. MxOy-1 obtained from the fuel reactor can react with H2O in the steam 
reactor to produce H2. Taking Fe2O3 as an example of metal oxide and CO as the fuel 
according to the reactions (Wang,",168,"[ 0.00746693  0.02103311 -0.00840393 ...  0.00708282 -0.02371027

The function of metal oxides is to transport oxygen, so they are called oxygen carriers 
(OC). The equations R4 and R5 show that CLHG system requires a good reaction 
between metal and H2O, so the type of oxygen carrier is particularly important. Some 
researchers (Chen et al. 2011 ) (Gupta, Velazquez-Vargas, Fan 2007 ) (Kang et al. 2010 ) 
(Yu et al. 2019 ) (Zhang and Jin 2013 ) compared oxygen carriers containing Ni, Cu,

suitable for CLHG. Fe-based oxygen carrier is popular because of its low cost and 
environmentally friendly. Müller et al. (2011 ) used 100 wt.% Fe2O3 as the OC for 
a chemical looping process, and stable quantities of H2 were produced over five cycles. 
Gupta, Velazquez-Vargas, and Fan (2007 ) reported that during the chemical looping 
process the iron-based oxygen carrier enables the synthesis gas to obtain a high 
conversion rate, at the same time, hydrogen production rate is also higher. But it 
also has many disadvantages. Limited by the thermodynamic characteristics, the 
reduction rate of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 is fast, but the reduction rate to FeO and Fe is 2

endothermic reaction, so more energy will be consumed (Adanez and Abad 2012 )

Although the increase of temperature is conducive to the reduction of Fe2O3 to FeO/Fe, 
it also promotes the positive reaction of R7, leading to the increase of CO production in 
the gas and the decrease of CO 2. At the same time, high temperature is also easy to cause 
OC sintering. In order to improve the activity of Fe-based OC, a lot of studies have 
focused on the modification optimization of Fe-based OC, such as adding metals Ni, Cu, 
K, etc. (Luo, 2017). Yang et al. (2014 ) studied the effect of Cu modified hematite as OC

studies were carried out on the CLHG system using Cu-Fe oxygen carriers (Adánez- 
Rubio, 2014 ) (Niu et al. 2016 ) (Niu and Xiao 2018 ) (Wang, 2017a ). The results showed 
that CuFe 2O4 was found in Cu-Fe OC, which were highly active and not easily sintered. 
The stability of OC during multiple cycles is very important for CLHG system (Vos et al. 
2018 ). Researchers (Imtiaz et al. 2016 ) (Liu et al. 2015 ) reported that pure Fe2O3 has 
a poor cyclability and deactivation occurs rapidly in the reduction of Fe3O4 to Fe within 
the first few cycles. It can be modified if the OC is supported on refractory oxides such as 
Al. The addition of Al2O3 will decrease the reduction rate of OC but can alleviate the OC 
sintering, in addition, it can also alleviate the heat absorption problem in the reduction 
process, because FeAl 2O4 will be exothermic when",256,"[-0.00524069  0.01011319  0.03016774 ...  0.00534502 -0.01075753

the characterization of Al2O3 and MgAl 2O4 supported Fe-based OC for CLHG. It was 
found that after 60 cycles the deactivation of Fe2O3-Al 2O3 OC was serious, but the 
MgFeAlO x OC had a relatively high reactivity and strong anti-sintering ability.
In the previous studies on chemical looping technology (Luo 2017), the research 
on gaseous fuel is extensive, while the solid fuel is still limited in its application due 
to its own characteristics, mainly due to the contact mode between the fuel and the 
oxygen carrier. In the fuel reactor, the order of the reaction rate with Fe2O3 is H2 
> CO> CH 4 > solid fuel. During the hydrogen production by coal direct chemical 
looping (CDCL) process, low reduction rate and high endothermicity are two major 
drawbacks. In addition, Si in coal ash react with Fe to form Fe2SiO 4, which has a low 
melting point resulting in easy",237,"[ 0.00056844  0.00430708  0.01160479 ...  0.00443609 -0.0237256

Therefore, it is of great significance for CDCL to seek an efficient separation method 
between coal ash and oxygen carrier.
In this study, the characteristics of coal direct chemical looping hydrogen produc -
tion were studied using a double plate-fixed bed reactor. The coal and the OC are 
layered in the fuel reactor. The gasification of coal and the reduction reaction of OC 
were integrated in the same furnace. The coal is first gasified by steam, and the 
reducing gas produced reacts with the OC to achieve the purpose of OC reduction. 
The reaction device solves the problem of separating coal ash from the OC. In this

during high-temperature calcination. CuFe 2O4 is a mineral with a quadrangle spinel 
structure, which is conducive to promoting the diffusion of gas and increasing the reaction 
rate. The synergistic effect can not only improve the reactivity of Fe2O3, but also improve 
the anti-sintering ability of CuO (Niu et al. 2016 ). The main forms of metals in the reduced

indicates that FeO is more easily oxidized by H2O than Cu. When the particle size range was

Therefore, it is important to choose the right fuel and gasification. Figure 7c shows the XRD 
patterns of OC obtained under different reduction time conditions. After 19 min of FR 
reaction, the metal in the OC were Fe3O4 and Cu, and it had no change in composition after 
the SR reaction resulting in no H2 generation. However, after the reduction time was 
changed to 15 min, the metal forms in the OC were mainly FeO, Fe and Cu2O. This 
indicates that since coal gasification uses H2O as the gasifier, the reduction time should be 
controlled to avoid the reaction of H2O with the reduced OC to produce H2 at the end of the 
reaction. This not only reduces the production of H2 in SR stage, but also affects the purity 
of CO 2 in FR stage.

distribution of Cu, Fe and O elements in fresh oxygen carriers. It can be seen from the figure 
that Fe and O elements are evenly distributed, and Cu elements are densely distributed in 
some regions, which will affect the formation of CuFe 2O4 and lead to the existence of metal 
oxides in the fresh oxygen carriers in the form of CuFe 2O4, Fe2O3 and CuO. Figure 8b–c

that the oxygen consumed in the reduction process of oxygen carrier is preferentially 
derived from CuO. In the hydrogen production stage, Fe/FeO will preferentially oxidize 
with H2O, so that Cu mainly exists in the elemental form after the SR stage, resulting in the 
increase of Cu molar ratio and the decrease of O molar ratio, which is consistent with the 
conclusion of XRD analysis before. As can be seen from Table 3, the specific surface area 
and pore volume of the oxygen carrier increase first and then decrease, because the oxygen 
consumption during the reduction process makes the oxygen carrier particles become 
porous. After hydrogen production reaction, the reduced metal oxide is partially oxidized 
by water vapor, making part of pores and voids filled, resulting in the decrease of specific 
surface area and pore volume.COMBUSTION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

1. Introduction
1.1. Syngas preparation
CO and H 2are the main components of syngas, being widely
applied as the starting material in various ﬁelds of chemical syn-
theses [ 1e6]. Although syngas can be obtained from coal or coke,
and heavy oil or light hydrocarbons, the chemical looping gasi ﬁ-
cation (CLG) can also be applied to produce syngas [ 6,7]. Based on
preliminary results for the syngas production, CLG has the potentialto achieve lower costs and higher power ef ﬁciencies than other
technologies [ 8] with a net ef ﬁciency of around 41 e42% [ 9e11].1.2. CLG
In the process of CLG, where H
2and CO are the main compo-
nents, originating from the oxygen carrier reacting with the prod-
uct of coal/biomass devolatilization/gasi ﬁcation [ 9]. Comparing the
CLG process with the chemical looping combustion, the CLG can

E:\\PINNs-Research\\Searched Articles\\Syngas preparation by NiOeCaSO4-based oxygen carrier from.pdf,2,1,"many researchers are investigating CLG for metallic oxides,
including Cu, Fe, Co, and Ni oxides and other compounds, such as
CaSO 4[13e16]. CuO is good at transferring oxygen in the lignite
chemical looping gasi ﬁcation, which has been conformed by Den-
nis et al. [ 13]. Huang et al. applied the Fe-based material (natural
iron ore) has been used as the oxygen carrier for CLG of biomass
char, indicating that it is a good oxygen carrier candidate for char
gasiﬁcation [ 14]. Researchers found that the oxide of Mn, Co, Fe and
Ni were used as oxygen carriers can promote carbon conversion in
the process of chemical looping gasi ﬁcation [ 12,15,16]. CaSO 4-based
materials are one of the most attractive oxygen carriers for indus-
trial applications [ 17e19] due to their outstanding oxygen storage
and release capability via the circular switching of CaSO 4/CaS redox
couple [ 20e22]. Phosphogypsum (PG) is the by-product of the
chemical industry in high amounts, low applicability, and seriously
harmful to the environment [ 23,24]. And its main active ingredient
is CaSO 4. Usually, an oxygen carrier consists of a mixture of sub-
stances that can provide better properties than its single compo-
nent, such as the lattice oxygen reactivity, structural defects, and
anti-sintering ability [ 9]. In order to improve the structure of the
oxygen carrier, Cu, Fe, and Al has been combined to form theCu
0$95Fe1$05AlO 4compound as an oxygen carrier [ 25]. At the same
time, in other investigations, ZrO 2-supported Fe 2O3eMnO 2showed
improved thermal stability and reaction performance for CLG [ 26].

in CLG, several inert compounds have been used as their supporting
material [ 9]. Jin et al. added several supports to improve the reac-
tivity of Co-based oxygen carriers [ 27], while Yan et al. found that
PG doped with a transitional element can reduce the thermal
decomposition temperature of PG [ 28].
Most CLG tests have been carried out in the ﬂuidized bed re-
actors (interconnecting ﬂuidized bed, circulating ﬂiuidized bed and
so on) and ﬁxed bed reactors (thermogravimetric analysis appa-
ratus, tube furnace and so on). Each reactor has its own advantages.
Theﬁxed bed is easy to operate and the conversion rate of ﬂuidized
bed fuel is more higher. Researches were con ﬁrmed ﬂuidized bed
reactors can be applied to analyze thermochemical conversion
because of their ability of near-constant temperatures and favour-
able mixing features [ 29]. Thermogravimetric analysis apparatus
has been applied to analyze the char conversion [ 9]. To explore the
thermodynamic and kinetic of lignite chemical looping gasi ﬁcation
with CuO eCaSO 4oxygen carrier, the tube furnace reactor has been
used [ 2].
2. Objectives
In the previous studies, PG has been used as a single oxygen
carrier to prepare syngas by CLG using lignite as the fuel [ 6,30],
where the reaction temperature was ~1173 K, making this process
uneconomic, even if in large-scale industrial productions, cost-
efﬁciency is the leading and essential point to implement a
chemical process. The main issue of CLG with PG is to lower the
reaction temperature. In the investigations of Yan et al. [",403,[0.00651689 0.011889   0.01435743 ... 0.01092309 0.02047484 0.03286468]
E:\\PINNs-Research\\Searched Articles\\Syngas preparation by NiOeCaSO4-based oxygen carrier from.pdf,2,3,"28], it was
found that oxygen carrier, along PG can form an oxygen carrier,
which can be an ideal candidate to solve this problem.In the present study, using the Ellingham diagram, an oxygen
carrier was found, preparing and characterizing the as-prepared
material. To test its activity, the CLG experiments were carried out.
3. Experimental
For the present work, PG and lignite were purchased from
Yunnan, China. And the composition of the material can be found in
Table 1 .
3.1. Oxygen carrier preparation
The oxygen carrier was prepared through the precipitation
method, where nickel (II) nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO 3)2$6H2O) was
dissolved in deionized water, adding the PG (in the form of powder)
slowly, in order to obtain a mixture with a different molar ratio of
Ni and PG. Meanwhile, the pH of the mixed solution was adjusted to
z8e9 using ammonia. Afterward, the samples were dried at 393 K
overnight then placed into a muf ﬂe furnace to be calcined at 773 K
for 300 min. The calcined materials were crushed, sieved, and
stored in a desiccator, being labeled as NiO eCaSO 4.
3.2. Characterization
The dispersion of elements of the oxygen carrier was observed
using an FEI Inspect S Scanning Electron Microscope-Energy
Dispersive Spectrometer (SEM-EDS). The group of Ni in the oxy-
gen carrier has been investigated by X-ray photoelectron spec-
troscopy (XPS) with a Thermo ESCALAB 250XI system and by
Xplora Plus Ranman Microscope (Horiba Company, France). To
analyze the crystal structure and the phase composition of

scanning region of 5 e90/C14.
3.3. Ellingham diagram
The Ellingham diagram showed the dependence of the stability
of a substance on temperature, based on thermodynamics. The
Gibbs free energy of the metal oxidation, corresponding to C and H,
was plotted against temperature. From the view point of applica-
bility, an ideal oxygen carrier in CLG should undergo multiple cycles
of operation with a minimal loss in physical integrity and chemical
reactivity. The redox potential of a metal oxide can be predicted
using the Ellingham diagram [ 12,31], where the standard Gibbs free
energy change of any reaction at any temperature can be calculated,
and the suitable oxygen carrier can be found [ 29].
3.4. Experimental analysis
The performance of NiO eCaSO 4oxygen carrier with lignite was
evaluated using a KTL1600 tube furnace, using different molar ra-
tios (NiO/CaSO 4: 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.25, 1.5) with 80 mash at different
temperatures from 873 K to 1073 K. During the experiments, ni-
trogen (99.999%) was used to remove air from the reactor in the

Besides, >95% carbon conversion was obtained as the molar ratio of

the effect of the nickel content of NiO eCaSO 4on the conversion of
the carbon was signi ﬁcant. In the CLC systems with bituminous coal
as fuel, the nickel-based oxygen carrier particles usually have good
performance [ 39e41].
Furthermore, there is a high reactivity of Ni-based oxygen car-
riers when they are reacted with the products of the gasi ﬁcation
process [ 42]. Therefore, in the case where Ni is present in the ox-
ygen carrier NiO eCaSO 4, the fraction of CH 4in the exhaust gas is
lowered. However, the fraction of CO 2decreased and then

shown in Fig. 7 (B), i.e., CO was generated by the reaction of
NiOeCaSO 4with lignite. When there was a higher concentration of
Ni, the reaction was promoted with CO to consume CO and to
produce CO 2.Fig. 7 (C) shows that the value of H 2/CO, in contrast,
increased with the increasing of the nickel content. This indicates
that a suitable amount of Ni can promote the generation of H 2,C O ,
and CO 2.Fig. 8 shows the reduced products of NiO eCaSO 4, where
the main products are Ni, CaS, and Ni 3S2. It can be concluded that
NiO and CaSO 4, jointly promote the lignite gasi ﬁcation process.

tionally, the primary reactions of CO generation are R6 and R7. The
main reaction for the consumed CO can be found in R8 when more
NiO exists. The oxygen carrier can ﬁx the S element in the gas
product via R9. Meanwhile, it would be poisoned and lost the active
ingredient of Ni because of S element [ 12].
Based on the above analysis, it can be concluded that the Ni
content of the oxygen carrier is essential for the conversion of
carbon and the production of CO, CO 2,and H 2. For less CO
consumed, the recommendable molar ratio of NiO vs. phospho-
gypsum is ~1:1.

selected to take under the loupe the in ﬂuence of temperature on Xc,

carbon at high reaction temperatures were higher than those at low
temperatures. Thus, the higher temperature accelerates the reac-
tion of the oxygen carrier and lignite (R6 and R7) [ 6,29], resulting in

other hand, higher temperatures eventually can decrease the gen-
eration of CO 2, as shown in Fig. 9 (B). Inevitably, more hydrogen
gases are formed in the gaseous product, because higher temper-atures are promoting R4 and R5.
Therefore,it can beconcludedthathightemperature promotes the
production of CO and H
2production. Compared with only PG as the
oxygen carrier in the previous work [ 6], the NiO eCaSO 4oxygen car-
rier plays a well-de ﬁned role in CLG for syngas under lower temper-
atures. Thus, NiO eCaSO 4decreases the reaction temperature of CLG
for syngas generation, thus providing a cost-ef ﬁcient approach.
Syngas also can be produced via coal or coke gasi ﬁcation and
other ways. Most of the researchers are focusing on methods based
on catalysts. For example, Vasconcelos et al. have prepared syngas
with ruthenium- and platinum-based catalysts and the results

lead to a stronger oxygen capacity of PG (high conversion of carbon

during the process of circulation, the microstructure of the oxygen

A novel way is proposed to prepare NiO eCaSO 4as oxygen car-
riers with the industrial waste-PG. The as-obtained material has
shown improved characteristics such as it has a good dispersion of

NiO with a slight rhombohedral distortion. Furthermore, a sym-
metric and an asymmetric stretch mode of sulfate anion (SO 42/C0)w a s

for the reuse of oxygen carrier.
